<p>
Again, the song sings of revenge. Bets does not deny it, this time. Does not shy away from the sweetness of it. 
<br><br>
But there is something else there, thrumming in his chest. A hesitance that remains even as he sifts through the black and red crate, that makes him curse at the way his hands shake as he picks up the collapsed blade. Just a bit. Still more than he’s used to.
<br><br>
He should want this. But he’s not sure he does.

[TEACH ACE WINTERS A LESSON]
<br><br>
///
</p>
<p>
The goliath suit feels alive, the way that the muscles and sinew that it is woven from act to propel him forward through the halls. He is grateful for it, that unnatural propulsion, because his feet feel heavier than normal, even as the whispers croon in his ears, urging him ever onward. East. South. Past the bar, down to engineering, where he peers into atmos, leaning heavily on the counter. He almost doesn’t notice the reptilian engineer that approaches him, cocking their head questioningly. He coughs, both to mask his surprise and to coax his mangled throat into allowing words to rise up through it.
<br><br>
<em>“Just checkin’ on cooled gases,”</em> he lies, the act of speaking taking much more effort than the lie itself. The engineer nods, and to his surprise, allows him to slip through the windoor into the department. There are certain advantages, he thinks, to his newfound soft spokenness. Even clad in the meat of slain monsters, he is not perceived as a threat. He hopes that<strong>—HE HAS TO KILL THEM-SO MUCH CAPACITY FOR VIOLENCE ISN’T IT A WASTE IF THERE IS ONLY ONE END TODAY—</strong>they are not here when he does what he has to—
<br><br>
—wants to—
<br><br>
—he does want this, right?
<br><br>
And then, there is no more time to ask himself what he wants, because there he is, coming up through the doors to the south. He knows he turns too quickly, knows that Ace recognizes the sharpness of it, and almost wonders if Ace can hear the violent tone that peals through his mind. Because he backs up as Bets approaches him, airlocks sliding shut between them, and Bets is nearly shaking now<strong>—THE SWORD-THE SWORD CAN TEAR THROUGH-BITE THROUGH METAL AND GLASS AND FLESH AND BONE—</strong>but he tries to breathe, to dredge up some modicum of reason from the tumult in his mind.
<br><br>
<em>“Look,”</em> he says, <em>“I just… I gotta know.”</em> He raps a gauntleted knuckle against the glass. <em>“But I don’t wanna have this conversation through…this.”</em> Ace’s eyes sharpen, and yet he still opens the door, lets him in. Maybe he can tell that there is something genuine in the request, something that Bets needs to hear. Because he does, he needs to know: Does he want this?
<br><br>
It is foolish, but perhaps they are both fools in their own way. Ace for letting him into the room. Bets for letting Ace give him an answer he doesn’t want when he asks, <em>“Did it fix anything? What you did to me?”</em>
<br><br>
His heart sinks when Ace frowns, and waves a hand in a motion even Bets can interpret without issue. Noncommittal. So-so.
<br><br>
<em>“Shit,”</em> Bets exhales. <em>“That’s not…what I wanted.”</em>
<br><br>
The energy sword flares to life with a buzz that harmonizes beautifully with the music in his mind, and Ace turns, and perhaps there <em>is</em> some small bit of satisfaction that curls up around Bets’s heart when the other man runs, when fear spurs on his steps. But the blows land empty, and Ace’s hands barely wrap around the haft of the fireaxe before they go limp, and he collapses. Still, unmoving. Bets sighs, frowning down at him with an expression tinged with melancholy.
<br><br>
<em>“It woulda made that feel a whole lot better if it did,”</em> he finishes.
<br><br>
There are witnesses, but the station is small, and they all know that he could<strong>—LEAVE NOTHING BUT CORPSES-THEY ARE NOT YOUR FRIENDS THEY ARE FUEL AND YOU ARE FLAME-WHAT IS YOUR PURPOSE IF NOT TO DEVOUR?—</strong>level the place if he wanted to. But he doesn’t. So he is allowed to walk through the halls, trying to ignore the mix of hate and fear and pity that permeates the air around him like corpse-stench. He can only think of one way to avoid it, one person who won’t look at him like something changed (he has always been <em>this</em>, always been capable, even if they did not see it).
<br><br>
So he once again allows his feet to carry him to engineering, and Ace approaches the front desk with a quizzical look. <em>“I owe you a drink,”</em> Bets hisses, and the confusion on the other man’s face only deepens. Bets sighs, reaches into his bag, and pulls out the small black handle concealed within it. There’s no need for secrecy, not now. He flicks the sword on and off, and understanding seems to register as Ace glances at it, then at the burns on his arms. Bets tenses, words springing to mind unbidden:
<br><br>
<em>“Now you’re like me.”</em>
<br><br>
His scarred cheek twitches. No. He didn’t mean to. That wasn’t his goal. This is not the same, they are not the same.
<br><br>
And yet.
<br><br>
It is with thoughts of flame that Bets walks with Ace to the bar.

<p class="quote">

</p>
<p>
It starts out so well.
<br><br>
Bets lets the mask of incompetence he has been wearing fall. It was too easy, delaying power just long enough for it to become a cascade issue, plunging the station into darkness. The cargo bay sits quiet, and he turns on his heel, knowing his science uniform marks him as a trespasser, someone who *should* be considered a risk.
<br><br>
But she doesn’t. She should. But she doesn’t.
<br><br>
Aoife approaches him. Too close. He needs her dead, needs so many dead.
<br><br>
Needs to die. He’s trying not to think about that part.
<br><br>
She smiles, a little confused, but trusting. He hates it. She has seen the bodies he has left behind, seen him fire a gun into the medbay wall, seen him cuffed and bloodied and surrounded by security officers that hover over him as he is brought back. But she still trusts him. Trusts him when he says, <em>“Your doors are open.”</em> Trusts him when she replies, “I should fix that,” and when he returns a simple <em>“You probably should.”</em>
<br><br>
She trusts him until he raises the gun and fires round after round into her chest.
<br><br>
She is gasping on the floor, and he has his tail wrapped around her throat as he drags her back towards cargo, as he fumbles through her pockets and her bag. He straightens, holding her PDA and the digiboard. He curses. Barely enough money for anything useful. Still, he flies toward the ATS, casting her body into space before—
<br><br>
Shit. They’re bringing the shuttle back. He was sloppy.
<br><br>
His hands dance towards his bag, wrapping around the plastic explosives within. Maybe enough to buy time, buy him an escape. They are not. The captain cuts him down smoothly, and everything goes blessedly dark, and at least it is—
<br><br>
—not over.
<br><br>
He gasps. Molly is standing over him, and the song is so loud, and he is gripped with a terror that forces pitiful attempts at a scream up from his lungs.
<br><br>
<strong><em>“WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO PUT ME DOWN JUST FUCKING SHOOT ME I CAN’T GO HOME PLEASE YOU HAVE TO PUT ME BACK—”</em></strong>
<br><br>
But it is all pity, or all business, and nothing that will make them push him back under into the dark. He can’t survive. He can’t go back to that fear, that replaceability, that guillotine hung sharp above his neck.
<br><br>
Bets-It-All has to die. 
<br><br>
They drag him to evac, and he is begging for death, for hands that will reach up and close tight around his throat, but nobody will listen. This is the price of being loved: Despite the blood on his hands, despite the fear in their eyes, despite the way he pleads and thrashes, no one will silence him.
<br><br>
Save, perhaps, for one.
<br><br>
<em>“I need Ace,”</em> he whispers, the screaming having reduced what little remains of his speech to a wheeze.
<br><br>
It’s always an ace that turns the tide of a losing hand. Bets makes one more reach for the deck, and prays to gods that he doesn’t believe in that he will see the face of the man that he does.
<br><br>
The secoff, Maeve, turns to him, somewhere between exasperation and confusion. “Why?” she asks.
<br><br>
<em>“I can’t go back,”</em> he says again. <em>“They have all of me, Maeve.”</em> And something in her face shifts, and she mouths words he cannot hear before she is moving once again, pulling him back into the station.
<br><br>
They encounter Ace just north of evac. “Take him before I change my mind,” she says, shoving Bets roughly towards the salvager. Ace’s expression reads profound confusion, only worsening as Maeve leaves, but his hand shifts towards Bets’s restraints like a practiced movement.
<br><br>
Which, really, it is. They’ve done this before, haven’t they?
<br><br>
<em>“I need to die.”</em> The words are barely audible, even as the two stand, nearly touching, connected by a hand wrapped around metal cuffs. Ace’s mouth twists downward. <em>“Either you can do it, or I can do it myself,”</em> Bets continues, but both of them know that the second option is unlikely to be enough. And both, for their own reasons, know it <em>needs</em> to be enough.
<br><br>
Ace’s expression tells him that there is more to be said, but neither of them has the words to say it.
<br><br>
They wander, for a while, Ace seeming to be making up his mind as they walk, Bets following in his wake. They cross in front of the medbay, and Ace glances towards it, in the direction of the surgery room. Of course, it’s here again. Amber. But he shakes his head, and he pulls him towards the bar.
<br><br>
<em>“Drink f-first,”</em> he says, silence broken. Evac is gone. There is no one to hear it aside from the only other person who knows the sound of his voice. Bets nods. Without power, they are limited to the meagre leavings already on the counter, likely abandoned in the earlier chaos. Bets smirks, despite himself, at one of the options placed before him.
<br><br>
Brave bull. It’s what he drinks on the bad days. And today certainly counts.
<br><br>
Choice made, Ace brings it to his lips. He swallows, the alcohol soothing him ever so slightly. It is a kindness, he recognizes, even if he will not feel whatever comes next. Strange, isn’t it? The tenderness with which the man who maimed him prepares him to die?
<br><br>
<em>“One d-d-day,”</em> Ace says as he readies the blade against his throat, <em>“We’ll have th-that t-talk.”</em>
<br><br>
When he is brought back, gasping, from the depths of the cloning pod, he will feel it. The knife in Ace’s hand. The way it smoothly parts the flesh of his throat. He will watch as the red mouth opens in his neck, intersecting another scar made by another blade during another failed death. 
<br><br>
He will notice the hesitation in the movement. The way his hands shake.
<br><br>
<em>“I’d like that,”</em> Bets says.
<br><br>
The world goes dark for good this time.

<p>
The song screams, and the gun kicks back in his hands as Maeve falls (he should feel bad for this, given her kindness. Before. But he does not have the capacity for such things as guilt, not now). One down, one to go. If he can take out the other member of security, he can get into the armory, and then the captain will be easy prey. But any sense of triumph is cut short as movement erupts around him, Attacus and Molly running out of the medbay, fighting to pull her away from him. He pulls the disabler out of his pocket. He won’t hurt them, can’t, but he <em>can</em> slow them down. 
<br><br>
And then Ace rounds the corner, and looks almost…sad.
<br><br>
(Seeing Ace enter the cargo department, hair still dripping cryo fluid onto the baggy salvage uniform hanging off of his frame, had been a surprise. Bets was somewhat startled to find that it was not an unwelcome one, despite the tension that hung in the air. He nodded, and Ace had returned the motion. 
<br><br>
They worked well together, really, and Bets found himself enjoying the company, despite what lingered between them. Perhaps it was a comfort, to feel something like closeness without the fear of what would happen when the song urged him to put a bullet through his companion’s head. It had already been done. Would likely be done again. Neither of them wanted, needed, protection or accommodation from the other. There would be blood, and there would still be a hand holding out a carton of cigarettes and shaking it as the other searched his bag for a smoke.)
<br><br>
Ace does not draw a gun, something that surprises Bets, because the two are alike enough that he is sure that he *has* one. Instead, he moves quickly forward, reaching out and seizing him by the shoulders, pushing. Bets pushes back, the two briefly locked together, at an impasse, before Bets realizes the intent behind the motion. He sighs.
<br><br>
<em>“Alright,”</em> he says, <em>“alright.”</em>
<br><br>
He falls backwards into disposals, and is whisked away. He lands at the security officer’s feet, and laughs.
<br><br>
</p>

<p>
Bets bides his time in the cell. Tries not to move his hand towards the ID in the small, clear pocket on the chest of his uniform. Patience. Patience. He saw the way that Diane looked at him through the security department’s windows. Knows it won’t be long until—
<br><br>
—the shooting starts.
<br><br>
Maeve and Manamari both bolt out of the department, and Bets is moving, pulling his hardsuit and jetpack out of the evidence locker and strapping them on as quickly as he can. He needs a weapon, something more than the PKA, needs to…
<br><br>
He turns. The armory stands behind him. The song pulls his mouth into a grin, a chorus sung by a bloodthirsty choir. 
<br><br>
Maeve is out of ammo, and fear flashes in her eyes before she dies, falling backwards into a pool of her own blood. Shell casings lie scattered across the ground, and Bets takes her gun, strapping it to his back before adjusting his grip on the drozd in his hands. The bridge is north, and within will be…
<br><br>
The captain comes around the corner when he hears the airlocks open, his lips parted as if to ask for a sitrep, his eyes widening when he sees not Attacus, not Maeve, but a salvager aiming down the sights of an automatic weapon. He does not have time to draw his own gun, but he turns, trying to run. The bullets tear through him, radiant percussion, decorating the bridge in a spray of metal and blood and meat. Bets stands over him, and fires a few more rounds into his body for good measure. Then it’s all business, stripping him of his bag, hands dancing under the collar of his suit to deactivate his coords. Dragging him into maints, shoving him into a locker, pulling it into space, and—
<br><br>
—quiet. The job is done. Bets inhales deeply, the silence almost overwhelming. He doesn’t know where to go, but he doesn’t want to stay out here, in the absence of everything, watching the locker drift away.
<br><br>
<em>“I’m sorry, Lotash,”</em> he whispers. <em>“I really do like you, most of the time.”</em>
<br><br>
Habit brings him back to the salvage dock. It is foolish, but at this point, he isn’t sure that anyone who wanted to stop him could. The guns sit heavy on his hip and on his back. He moves towards the airlock, and notices two objects on the ground in front of it:
<br><br>
The first, a carton of Interdynes. Half empty. His favourites, as he told Ace earlier in the shift, in response to an outstretched, offering hand. The second, a note.
<br><br>
<em>You’re lucky I don’t want to shoot you.</em>
<br><br>
There is movement out of the corner of his eye, and he looks up. Ace has walked into the department,has seen him, and stopped. Bets nods. Ace returns it. Slowly, cautiously, Bets walks inside. Moves close enough for the other man to hear it when he speaks.
<br><br>
<em>“I am,”</em> he replies. And he is.
<br><br>
He thinks he has found something close to a friend.
