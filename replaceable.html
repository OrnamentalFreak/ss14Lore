It’s a message.
<br><br>
Bets is certain of this much, at least, as he drags his eyes across the fallen body in the hardsuit. He’s not sure what he’s searching for, really. A sign it’s not actually his own? They say that you wouldn’t recognize yourself from the outside, since you’re so used to mirror images, but he thinks that’s bullshit. This is him. Even sprawled out, features obfuscated by blood and gristle and exposed bone. The blast couldn’t erase it all, all those scarred and warped pieces of himself that he has fought to make peace with.
<br><br>
This is him. And yet it isn’t.
<br><br>
He knows he wouldn’t have done it. Overclocked the AME with Everett in the room. He wouldn’t have. Right? 
<br><br>
Ev is the first to tell him to look away, to usher him out of the room where it—where he—lies dead. She patches the holes in the floor (and oh god there are pieces of him stuck in the skeleton of the station), and Whack tells him not to think about it. But how can he not?
<br><br>
All this time, he thought he was afraid of not feeling. He is realizing, now, how much of what he does can be attributed to a fear instead of being forgotten.
<br><br>
The message is simple:
<br><br>
You can be replaced.
<br><br>
</p>
<p class="flashback">
“Today is important.”
<br><br>
The words hang heavy. He knows he did something on this station, something that caused them to relegate him back to service. So, something major. It’s not like they have the engineers to fill in the gaps right now. He won’t learn what, exactly, it was, or why Everett won’t look him in the eyes when she mentions it, until much later.
<br><br>
<span style="font-style:normal">(You, very explicitly, <em>only</em> didn’t hurt me.)</span>
<br><br>
But today is important. So he hides. Hides from the voices that sing of solace in violence. They promise him survival. It is something that he takes for granted. Hiding will be the death of him, and part of him knows that.
<br><br>
But today is important.
<br><br>
</p>
<p>
The agent finds them just west of evac, the elite suit stark black against the slight flicker of the fluorescent lights. Liquid shadow, moving closer, sounds dampened by the lack of atmosphere left by the shattered window.
<br><br>
If he was alone, it would be one thing. He could go down swinging, at least. They aren’t here for him. Maybe they’d only leave him half-dead. Cold comfort, that.
<br><br>
But he’s not alone. Drafts stands behind him, her towering form reduced to something small by fear. And that fear is well-earned. He has failed her too many times (and soon, soon he will again, elbow-deep in the spilled guts of a friend searching through the meat, screaming in a voice he barely recognizes as his own to FUCKING LET HIM IN FUCKING MOVE DO NOT TOUCH THE MMI DO NOT FUCKING BORG HER and the fact that he knows the motions to set the brain that sits too heavily in his hardsuited hands into its metal cradle haunts him). The agent says to stay off comms. He ignores them. Brings a hand to his head and whispers as forcefully as he can, <em> “Drafts, out the airlock, NOW, fucking GO,”</em> and the relief when she listens, when he hears the AI slide the bolts into place, makes him think that maybe it is worth it. Maybe this is his absolution.
<br><br>
He is the only one that has to die here, and maybe they will remember him as someone…not <em>good</em>. But a willing sacrifice for the people around him who <em>are</em>.
<br><br>
But Drafts has called sec, and the agent turns from where they have him backed into a corner, and he watches as the blood catches gravity, hears it now as it splatters across his helmet. It is only after he tells the officers to fuck off, that he wasn’t with them, after they are all out of sight that he begins to shake.
<br><br>
He needs a drink.
<br><br>
Even for him, it is probably too much. He remembers very little, save for the sterile smell of medbay, which he must have stumbled into at some point along the line. His memories come back into focus out on solars, the burn of exertion clearing his head as he breaks down chunks of meteor rock, lays scaffold and wires. Drafts wants to talk to him, but she can’t know. He doesn’t tell her more than he has to: He has made some people angry, but he’s fine. He’ll be fine.
<br><br>
He will be, he tells himself. As long as they don’t forget.
<br><br>
She also says that Everett is worried about him, and something inside him twists (always, always hands in guts, this time his own, bunching them together and pulling until it hurts so badly he wants to scream or cry or SOMETHING just to make it stop). He is still scrambling to figure out what lie to tell her when she pulls him aside at CentComm, but as he looks into her eyes he realizes he <em>just can’t</em>.
<br><br>
She has told him so much.
<br><br>
</p>
<p class="flashback">
He knew about her past, about the army, because she had told him. But now is the first time it feels <span style="font-style: normal;">real</span>to him, her back pressed against his as he keeps his sights trained on the hallway. “Clear.” They move as a unit, stepping softly into the cargo bay, eyes scanning the darkened area for the intruder that had fled through the department.
<br><br>
They step apart, his movements instinctive, hers practiced. The motions come to him in flashes: go now, turn here, gun up, cover there. The glimpses he catches of Everett are filled with precision. What is going through their head, he wonders. Is there comfort in knowing what to do? He doubts it. There are things that one is better off knowing how to do, but sometimes the circumstances of learning them are not worth the weight.

<p class=flashback>
“WHERE IS SHE?”
<br><br>
The pistol in his hands will leave bruises on his palms, he is gripping it so tightly, even through the durathread of his gloves. No one answers, no one will tell him, where the FUCK IS SHE—
<br><br>
“With Molly,” Drafts hisses, and he feels a moment of relief. But she still won’t tell them where. Why won’t anyone tell him where?
<br><br>
The answer is in a black bag on evac. He doesn’t have to open it, just has to look at the two figures staring at it, faces filled with a kind of sorrow he would not have comprehended mere months ago. But he can feel it, now, and his body rejects it like a thorn dug into his flesh. It wants to force it out, wants to burn it, overwhelm it with a fever that comes in the form of terror and rage.
<br><br>
Because he remembers what she told him. What they had forgotten to do. What he cannot let them do again.
<br><br>
Pleasepleasepleasedon’tfuckingforgetmenotyouIcan’tjustNOTYOU—
<br><br>
He grabs Molly’s arm, maybe harder than he means to. “We can’t let them clone her,” he whispers, hating how his voice shakes, fights to tear its way out of him as something raw and bleeding and too fucking loud.
<br><br>
“I know,” she says, and there is a determination that rises to the surface of the ocean that churns across her face, a defiant gasp that spits out mouthfuls of seawater. Not drowned yet. “We won’t let that happen.”
<br><br>
And they don’t. It isn’t until she takes that first gasp that he feels the dam begin to break. And of course, she wants to move, wants to help, but now is <span style="font-style: normal;">not the fucking time</span> and damn it she will REST.
<br><br>
He turns away before any of them see him cry.
<br><br>
</p>
<p>
The note folds in his grip, and he hates the anger that rises to the surface when he reads it. He knows that he’s hurting him, but it will hurt him more to get caught up in the thing that is coming for him (it has already tried once, today, in the form of a scientist slipping him an explosive pen. Not good enough. He isn’t sure that he likes how good it feels when she recoils as he leans towards her. “Most folks learn pretty quickly: If you’re gonna try to kill me? Make sure it works the first time.”)
<br><br>
“I’m not sure what you’re not fucking getting,” he says, and he hates the way that it makes him flinch away. “I don’t want your fucking help. Any of you. It’s not your fight. I can take care of myself.”
<br><br>
But this is the right thing to do, isn’t it? 
<br><br>
Garret is already too close.
<br><br>
</p>
<p class="flashback">
The bar is busy, but when Garret flags him down, Bets slinks away from the other patrons vying for their end-of-shift fixes. He said he needed to talk, and Bets knows that if <span style="font-style:normal;">he</span> of all people is admitting that, it’s worth the time.
<br><br>
He’s been hurt. Bets sympathizes, a hand moving to the scar on his face. By someone. Bets asks who. This is a mistake.
<br><br>
“All I remember is a black and red tail in a hardsuit.”
<br><br>
<span style="font-style:normal">(You, very explicitly, <em>only</em> didn’t hurt me.)</span>
<br><br>
Panic courses through him. He’s forgotten before, been pieced back together with spaces intentionally left empty. It is easier to prevent repeat offenses if you simply excise the violence. But he had believed that he wouldn’t, couldn’t—
<br><br>
“Omega.”
<br><br>
“Oh,” Bets says, and the panic subsides for just a moment before the guilt takes its place. The clone. It was the clone, it was always about sending a message, but that message wasn’t just for <em>him</em>, was it?
<br><br>
It’s going to kill them all if he keeps on running.
<br><br>
But run he does, just for today, out of the bar and down into maints, where he heaves until nothing comes up but bile.
<br><br>
It is going to kill them all.
<br><br>
</p>
<p>
He wakes up, each breath sending pain coursing through his chest (a novelty, that, how rarely does he feel it? Only ever on the inside, only ever when he’s waking up after…
<br><br>
…ah. She did get him, in the end.)
<br><br>
Garret is standing over him, and he is <em>angry</em> in a way Bets hasn’t seen before. Maybe, before, he would have found it touching. But now… What the hell does he find it, now?
<br><br>
He doesn’t know.
<br><br>
The laughter lurches out of him, surprising them both. He feels everything all at once, all the fear and sorrow and madness, bubbling up out of his guts, wrapping his heart and his throat and his mind in a lightness that feels like venom.
<br><br>
He can’t stop laughing.
<br><br>
His lungs heave in protest, and his voice is hoarse when he finally chokes it out:
<br><br>
“They’re gonna make me do it, Garret. 
<br><br>
They’re gonna make me do somethin’ very, very bad.”
