    <h3>PROJECT MINDBREAKER: DEMISHIELD PROTOCOL</h3>
    <p>
      AUTHOR: Broken-Fractals<br>
ENCRYPTION: HighSec<br>
<br>
BRIEF: Due to the catastrophic failures of iterations 1 and 2 (Alpha and Cadet), the Project Mindbreaker research team has developed a mindshield-like data structure to be encoded into future iterations’ pseudogenetics.

<strong>The Demishield: An Overview</strong><br><br>
The Demishield is based roughly off of NanoTrasen Mindshield technology. While we are keenly aware of the risks of adapting this technology for use in a brain developed specifically to destroy it, we believe that it is our current best option if we do not wish to continue bleeding time and personnel. 
<br><br>
Explaining the Demishield requires an explanation of its parent technology. I will keep this brief, as most of you should already know this, but Roots has instilled upon me the importance of thorough documentation. Therefore, if anyone has any complaints about this portion of the document: Take it up with her.
<br><br>
NanoTrasen Mindshields are chips implanted either at the base of the skull or in the “user’s” (for lack of a better word) temple. This allows them to send electromagnetic pulses directly to the brain. These pulses inhibit speech, movement, and even sentiment in stronger cases (usually in those who have undergone the procedure many times, or have been minshielded for extended periods). We also have reason to believe that NanoTrasen may encode certain data strings into memories stored in its databases, allowing for more tightly controlled thought patterns, but untangling that particular web would take more time than I have at my disposal, and is not terribly relevant to a project designed to break down the technology before it can interface with them to begin with.
<br><br>
As such, Project Mindbreaker is designed to be both a highly effective agent, and able to unconsciously bombard a Mindshield with enough of a data storm to render it entirely ineffective. However, that requires an immense amount of data, which we have chosen to source both from our training materials and from the NanoTrasen cloning database. Even that may not be enough—the technology is proving irritatingly resilient—but the amount of information already stored in that dataset has proven to be too much for subjects’ brains to handle. 
<br><br>
Enter the Demishield.
<br><br>
By analyzing the signals sent by Mindshields, namely those inhibiting thought patterns, we have isolated the parts of the brain targeted, and restructured the mind itself to target some of those sites automatically. This creates a type of layered, gated memory system: The present mind (identity, individual memories, current objectives), potential assets (combat training, personnel data, and other materials likely to be relevant to missions and day-to-day survival), and the core. The core is of particular note. It holds the vast, vast majority of the subject’s data, and is only accessible in minute amounts. Data may never return to it from the upper layers, but may be selectively accessed and migrated into accessible portions of memory if criteria are met. Generally, we expect this information to be retrieved in periods of crisis or conflict, or due to stimulus like pain, but the process is heretofore untested, and we will not have a full picture of what retrieval might look like without a period of observation.
<br><br>
In order to prevent the Mindbreaker Protocol from attacking the Demishield, we have relegated the Demishield encoding to that core memory threshold. As such, it should serve to partition itself off so long as the memory barriers remain intact. With that being said: The introduction of a Mindshield to this mix would likely result in catastrophic, cascade failure of the Demishield, as the protocol would be unable to distinguish between signals sent by the Mindshield and those already existing within the brain.
<br><br>
As with all things: One step forward, two steps back.
