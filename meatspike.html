Bets can’t remember how he and Tye started talking.
<br><br>
He’s sure they’d been coworkers at some point, shared a department, shared a medbay maybe after some ill-advised chemical consumption. But they didn’t really know each other, not really, until the bar.

Bets stands behind the bar, yawning. The shift has run long, and much as he enjoys mixing drinks and talking ears off, he’s getting tired. As the shock of blue hair bobs into his vision, he chuckles to himself. He can manage one more, surely. Especially if the patron is entertaining.
<br><br>
But as Tye gets closer, Bets realizes that he looks darkly serious, an expression that seems entirely alien on his face. He asks to talk, and Bets nods slowly. When he says it needs to be in private, Bets agrees, but mixes a drink first. Downs it to settle his nerves. Clutches the glass in his fist with thoughts of breaking it, drawing shards across a throat if necessary.
<br><br>
<em>"I need you to skip evac,"</em> Tye whispers after both have settled uneasily into armchairs in the bar’s dimly-lit back room. Bets raises an eyebrow. He was prepared to die back here. Go down swinging, sure, but die nonetheless. This, however, is unexpected. He sighs.
<br><br>
<em>"I guess."</em> He replies, noncommittal. Part of him wants to run, to fight, to bleed. To feel something. But mercy from the man beside him gives him pause. It is a rarity, he thinks, in a way that feels…fragile. 
<br><br>
He knows what Tye is capable of, so why spare <em>him</em>?
<br><br>
<em>Usually folks bribe a guy,"</em>" he adds, attempting to inject some levity, but the other man remains solemn.
<br><br>
<em>"I didn’t want to…do what they wanted me to."</em> Something in Bets twinges, and he stares at the floor. Faces blink across his vision, memories of blood and fire.
<br><br>
<em>"You’re a better person than me, for that,"</em> he says quietly.
<br><br>
<em>"Well. We’re friends. Normally."</em>
<br><br>
Bets nods. And just like that, they are.

Another bar, another station, nerves frayed. He fucking hates Omega, can’t stand being here after <strong>it</strong> happened. Can’t stand the way that the voidsuit seems to hang heavier off of his frame here. He blows a stream of smoke out from between his twisted lips, deformed further by the grimace on his face.
<br><br>
Tye rounds the corner, grinning. Bets shifts gears, pretends that his displeasure is rooted in the present more than the past. “Your coords are off,” he grumbles, and Tye waves him off. He never expects him to turn them on, but they’re familiar steps in an old dance now, and the attempt at least brings him some comfort.
<br><br>
He doesn’t want to lose anyone else here.
<br><br>
And yet, the dance comes with unintended consequences. Tye is insisting he is compassionate, he is good, and he can’t stand it. “It’s not goodness,” he exhales. “It’s selfishness.”
<br><br>
“How so?” 
<br><br>
Bets frowns, thinking. “I work, and I work, and I work keepin’ the people I give a shit about alive. That’s it. I mean, if I didn’t like you, I woulda declared you DNR a long time ago.” He means it as a joke, but Tye seems oddly taken aback.
<br><br>
“So…” he murmurs, “I’m a net negative.”
<br><br>
Bets grumbles to himself. Sighs. Speaks again. “That’s a shit interpretation of it. I mean that you bring more good to the folks around you than the worth of the chems you burn through. An’ I happen to like havin’ you around. So I’ll do it every time.”
<br><br>
The word “good” seems to strike a nerve. Not painfully, necessarily, but in a way that makes Tye freeze for a moment. “Good, huh…” he says, seemingly to himself. “I dunno, Bets. I do some terrible shit to people. I don’t…have lines, the way some people do.”
<br><br>
“Bullshit.” The word escapes Bets’s mouth before he can think, can slow its course. “I…” He fumbles desperately to piece together something more complete, something that will make Tye *understand*.
<br><br>
“I think,” he says finally, “if you didn’t have lines, I’d be dead.”
<br><br>
“Huh.” Tye takes a drag of his cigarette, two plumes of smoke rising to pool and spread across the ceiling. “I guess you’re right.”

<p>
Bets encounters Magdalena in front of cargo. She looks distant, concerned, a stark contrast from her usual vibrancy. He has work to do, he knows that, but he slows.
<br><br>
“Hey, Mags…” He trails off, unsure of how to continue. Comfort has never been his strong suit, and he has never been sure of which questions to ask. He doesn’t need to be, because she seems to intuit his intentions.
<br><br>
“I think…I’m about to lose one of my lives, Bets,” she says, her lisped speech reverberating slightly in the narrow hallway. He stiffens. She’s one of his, and he can’t let—
<br><br>
“That seems…bad,” he chokes out. “I ain’t lettin’ you die, Mags. Not on my watch.”
<br><br>
She smiles softy, shaking her head. “It’s not like that. It’s a belief, for my people. That we have nine lives, and in order to grow, we have to lose the things that make us ourselves. And then we come back better. More complete.”
<br><br>
Bets opens his mouth. Wants to tell her that the parts of yourself that make you <em>you</em> are the most important thing that he knows. That he doesn’t *want* her to lose them. But it’s not his place. So he closes it. Says he has to go, says to come find him in med if she needs to talk. She agrees.
<br><br>
Neither of them get the chance. The tesla reduces him to atoms in mere moments, tearing up north from its containment directly into medbay. He cannot make good on his promise, cannot protect her. Not in this life. 
<br><br>
And not the next, either.

Magdalena is dead. Maints. The small blue light, her only lifeline, flashes on the screen in front of him. Bets’s heart crawls up into his throat, and he can’t even bring himself to stop long enough to call his movement out over the radio. He is running, he is flying, and he knows this station like the back of his hand, because this is where <strong>it</strong> happened and he has studied it, memorized it, dreamed it so that <strong>it</strong> will never happen again. He pushes into maints, and the small voice in the back of his mind that screams that he is GOING to DIE is overwhelmed by protective instinct, by guilt. By the smell of ozone. 
<br><br>
By the smell of burning hair, burning fabric, burning flesh.
<br><br>
<strong>IT IS HAPPENING AGAIN IT IS HAPPENING AGAIN IT IS HAP—</strong>
<br><br>
Her body is ablaze, and Ardor is cast in the glow of her human pyre. And Bets cannot move, has to move, is being told not to move, is moving and Ardor has a knife and his blood hisses as it meets the flames leaping off of her still body. Gunfire. Ardor is going down, but the fire remains, and the man who does not yell is screaming over comms “WATER I NEED WATER SOMEONE ANYONE—” and she is gone.
<br><br>
Maints are dark, and she is gone, and it is just him and the ringing in his ears and the drip drip drip of his blood on the tile where there is nothing but ash and it is on his gloves and beneath his boots and his vision is blurring and he is stumbling back into the light and there are hands on his arms and voices and faces and he knows he is dying knows they are just worried and “DO NOT FUCKING TOUCH ME” his voice rises ragged and he thinks he may be weeping but the fire the fire the fire robbed him of everything and he cannot feel the tears on his face does not know.
<br><br>
He doesn’t really come back to his senses until he is outside the station, curled against the virology window. “It’s always fire,” he tells the stars. “Always fire.” But there is still life on the station. There are still lights on the crew monitor, blinking up at nobody. He has to go back. 
<br><br>
When he returns to the medbay, there is apple cake on the desk. The kind Mags likes to leave him.
<br><br>
“Salt the fucking wound,” he chokes, and the pity in the look that Verity gives him is enough to make him want to drive his fist through the glass of the window.
<br><br>
He drifts until evac, faces overlapping. He thinks he hears Pushes, telling him it would have been better if he had stayed dead. Thinks he sees Cori, terrified, backing away from him. Thinks he sees Everett, the way that their face collapsed in upon itself, the way that they were reduced to the same grey-black ash that now stains his gloves and the front of his suit.
<br><br>
He can’t bring himself to follow the others into the shuttle’s small medbay. Can’t be around so many faces full of sorrow that they think they deserve to share with him. He sits, staring out at the dark, alone. Quiet. Quiet until the blast throws him to the ground, until he’s dragged into medbay, gasping, barely clinging to consciousness. The second bomb pitches him into the dark, a darkness he does not wake from until he is brought back in a bed at CentComm.
<br><br>
He does not see the way that Tye calls his name. Pulls his body into the bridge. Begs him (BETS, STAY WITH ME PAL. IT’S GONNA BE OKAY) not to disappear as yet another explosion tears the heart of the evac shuttle out, leaving them cornered, stranded. The way that he pleads with him as he fights to bring him back, covered in Bets’s blood up to his elbows, trying to piece together the viscera of him (BETS. WAKE UP. WE FUCKIN’ NEED YA I CAN’T DO THIS SHIT BETS <strong>COME ON</strong>).
<br><br>
He doesn’t know.
<br><br>
He drags himself to his feet. Pulls Tye into a hug, not noticing the way that his blood smears across his salvage suit. And he gets to work.
<br><br>
He has to save those he still can. For those that he couldn’t.
