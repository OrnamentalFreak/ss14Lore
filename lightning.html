02.The Taste of Lightning
</h3>

<em>The taste of lightning.</em><br><br>
It creeps, familiar, into Bets’s mind. Something rooted deeply within him, even if he can’t trace the threads of memory back to an origin point. The doctors have fed him countless reasons for it: the trauma, the drinking, the drugs. The strain of death and rebirth, his pound of flesh paid to the corporation that allows him to just barely keep his head above water, as opposed to the ugly alternative. Not that he remembers what that alternative <em>is</em>, really.<br><br>
But that taste of lightning stings sharp on his tongue, calling forth old-Earth memories of the dark shell of the sky cracked open by bolts of light. But this is not Earth, and the booming thunder has been replaced by the sounds of screaming metal, screaming people. Somewhere, an explosion shakes the station, and he is gripped by the knowledge that this is his fault, his fault, his fault.<br><br>
The abacus in his mind flies, tallying debts accrued. The dead will forget, but the living? The living will come to collect. <br><br>
He curses himself. He should have asked for help sooner. Maybe then he would have seen the impact site sooner, the wires torn and sparking silently into space. He could have stopped this. But kindness always comes at a price. Flame licking at his flesh as an oh-so-generous teacher watched through a plasma-glass window. Hours spent surrounded by frozen corpses until the ERT team arrived, weighing the cost-benefit analysis of dragging one frostbitten engineer back to CentComm versus putting a bullet in his head and cloning him anew.<br><br>
He twitches, hands straying to the pills in his bag. But he can’t now. Not until he knows where they are. The two who had promised him help, as much as he loathed himself for the warmth that the offer filled him with, are the two to whom he owes the most, today.<br><br>
It’s close, now. The dry, electric air stings the inside of his nose as he fumbles, releases the catch on his helmet, and allows it to envelop him in metal and stale canned oxygen. He turns, ready to push back into the shell of the station (a death is, at least, a price paid against a balance outstanding), but the shuttle docks, and he is swept along by the crush of panicked bodies. He tries to make them out against the sea of people (more than he could have hoped, he realizes. Maybe there is still a chance).<br><br>
One of them, he does see. But not the other. Garret stands, wringing his hands. Bets begins to move towards him, but stops. He has not earned the question he wishes to ask, this man does not owe him the answer that he wants to hear. And to twist the knife in the wound that Bets increasingly believes to be present only adds coin to the other side of the scale. <br><br>
The shuttle docks at CentComm, and despite everything, he still hopes. Hopes in a way that feels dangerously like caring, until the lights begin to flicker, until he feels something like a hand on his shoulder, and he knows.<br><br>
Bets is a man haunted, now, and there is no debt heavier than a ghost.
