    <p>
      Bets has never been one for empty spaces, or empty time.
      <br /><br />
      As he pushes himself up through the haze of cryosleep into the stale, dry
      air of a freshly-awakened station, he becomes profoundly aware of how
      light his bag feels and of the lack of equipment on his belt. He frowns,
      swinging his grey-clad legs over the edge of the pod and towards the
      floor, shaking his head to free his ears of the last of the pod-sludge
      that evaporates almost immediately off of the steel tiles beneath him.
      Standing, he unclips his PDA from his hip, the screen flaring to life. He
      sighs.
      <br /><br />
      Passenger. Along for the ride. Nothing but time.
      <br /><br />
      He flicks through his files, and his eyes alight upon a recent request
      filed on his behalf. He squints. Stress leave. A snort escapes him. So
      that’s how they’re handling it. He had wondered, when Attacus had said he
      would put in a request for him to be granted shore leave, how this
      particular monkey’s paw would curl. His makers weren’t going to let him
      loose on a real planet, somewhere he could disappear into. The only time
      he was allowed to set boots on real dirt was on the rare few salvage
      expeditions he had gone on, and even then only because there were people
      to bring him back, and nowhere to go in those dying, infested places.
      <br /><br />
      He glances back at the cryopod. He could just give up. Go back under. But
      an alert flashes on the screen in his hands, and it gives him pause.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>[Ace Winters (Librarian) has arrived at the station.]</strong>
      <br /><br />
      The undamaged corner of his mouth curls upward, slightly. No song hums
      through his mind today, but this may still serve as a welcome distraction.
      Besides. The worst Ace can do to him for interrupting is kill him.
    </p>
    <p class="quote">///</p>
    <p>The library smells of paper and, faintly, cigarette smoke. Books are piled on the table when he arrives, and Ace stands hunched over them, hands moving deftly as he sorts them, seemingly by category. He looks up when the door hisses shut behind Bets, and cocks his head. But there is a touch of warmth in the confusion, and Bets smiles back. Strange, he thinks, the comfort one can find in someone who has robbed you of something so vital as a voice. But there is comfort in knowing that some lines have already been crossed, and that when they are inevitably crossed again, he will still see that warmth the next time he walks through the library doors.
<br /><br />
Maybe they’re fucked. He’s coming to peace with that.
<br /><br />
<em>“No work today,”</em> he grunts, knowing that Ace will be well aware of the double meaning. <em>“And I don’t…. I’m not good at havin’ nothin’ to do. So.”</em> He shrugs. Ace nods slightly, and reaches into his bag, withdrawing a sheet of paper. He ejects his pen from his PDA with one practiced motion, none of the fumbling that Bets undergoes doing the same. He sets the paper down on the table, and in his messy scrawl that Bets would recognize as <em>his</em> anywhere, now, writes:
<br /><br />
<em>You can stay here. If you want.</em>
<br /><br />
Ace does not make eye contact. They are both keenly aware of the strangeness of it, this bond forged by blood spilled again, and again, and again. But neither of them wants to be alone, even if both struggle to admit it. And this small offer, in exchange for nothing, grants Bets something that he has been lacking not just today, but for as long as he can remember: Space to exist, with no scales to balance.
<br /><br />
He eases himself into the chair, watching Ace work, feeling something close to comfortable.
<br /><br />
Bets is almost dozing off by the time the books have been completely sorted and shelved, and is stirred from his stupor by a series of sharp coughs, quiet but painful sounding. He cracks his eyes open and perks up an ear, and sees Ace rubbing his throat and grimacing. <em>“G-gonna… Chemistry. For s-smokes,”</em> he says in a hoarse whisper. <em>“You wan-n-na…come?”</em> He shuffles slightly, and while it could be mistaken for embarrassment, Bets thinks it is something else, something directed inward. A discomfort with the desire for company, for proximity. With the fact that he is asking the more-than-meat for his time and presence. A small smile flickers over Bets’s face. He nods.
<br /><br />
While he has been half asleep, Bets has not missed the coming and going of the library’s few patrons, or the way that Ace shifts around them. He becomes something so <em>different</em> from the man Bets knows. The same hands that held a scalpel over a twitching not-quite corpse, that shook as they drew a knife across his throat, dance across the spines of books. The same eyes that have passed over him with clinical precision, as if seeing the seams at which he could be most effectively torn apart, light up with curiosity upon the delivery of hand-written inquiries about favourite genres. The mouth that whispered <em>“Now you’re like me”</em> into his ear as Ace stood above his sedated, maimed body smiles with a kindness that is genuine, but does not quite reach his eyes. It’s strange, to see a gentler side of him.
<br /><br />
It is strange, too, that part of him is proud of seeing the other side of that coin. Of having something to himself. For now.
<br /><br />
They move together through the halls, catching sidelong glances at their whispered, gestured conversation. They make an odd pair, he knows, the librarian and the lizard with the burns on his face, made a pair by their matching scars. People are curious, good at identifying the presence of a story, but no one will ask it of the mute and the silenced. He laughs soundlessly. 
<br /><br />
When they return, Ace lights a tricordrazine-laced cigarette, and inhales deeply. He lets out a sigh of relief, smoke curling out of his mouth, and sits next to Bets, who lights a smoke of his own. Bets leans back, looking at the ceiling, and Ace slumps forward on the table. Abruptly, the man’s relaxed expression shifts into a frown.
<br /><br />
<em>“Wh-what did you d-do…to my work?”</em> He asks, put out, and Bets cocks his head, confused. He glances down, tracing Ace’s line of sight to…
<br /><br />
The scar. He laughs nervously, bringing a hand towards it without thinking, and—
<br /><br />
<em>“Were y-y-you…scratching it?”</em> A silent sigh moves the librarian’s shoulders as he sits up and leans towards him. <em>“I w-worked so ha-hard on the st-st-stitching…”</em> His frustration breaks his voice even more than Bets is used to, and he glances to the side.
<br /><br />
<em>“No,”</em> he says, fighting the nervous urge to claw at it.
<br /><br />
Ace grumbles to himself. <em>“Y-yes,”</em> he mutters, <em>“you d-did.”</em>
<br /><br />
The words leave Bets’s mouth before he can think better of them. <em>“Fix it, then.”</em> And there is the Ace he knows, teeth bared, ready for a challenge. Ring on his finger glinting in the fluorescent glow of the hallway lights, shining in through the library windows.
<br /><br />
<em>“M-maybe I will,”</em> he says simply, before his voice is broken by a cough, and he takes another long pull off of his cigarette.
<br /><br />
Bets hums, thoughtful. <em>“Y’know,”</em> he says, after a moment. <em>“It’s funny, you bein’ upset over one of my scars.”</em> Ace furrows his brow and cocks his head.
<br /><br />
(A quiet bar, only two people on the station. Eyes cast over burn scars, on his face, his arms, his hands. <em>“They tell stories, I guess. I just… I’m not always glad I can remember ‘em.”</em>
<br /><br />
<em>“You sh-should be glad they won’t g-get rid of th-them. They’re YOURS.”</em>)
<br /><br />
<em>“This scar is mine,”</em> Bets continues. <em>“And, yeah, it healed a little messy. But…”</em> He looks over, red eyes meeting white. <em>“The marks we leave on other people don’t tend to heal clean.”</em> The way Ace looks away, down at the table, tells Bets that he understands. That the marks that they have left on one another run deeper than flesh. 
<br /><br />
His cigarette burns down to the filter. He sighs, stubbing it out, and retrieving another. <em>“That’s alright, though,”</em> he says, bringing the smoke to his mouth, feeling the way that the nicotine numbs out his mind for just a moment as he inhales. <em>“I think it’s better if some things heal messy.”</em>
<br /><br />
<em>“Better story, that way.”</em>
