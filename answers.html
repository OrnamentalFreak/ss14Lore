They don’t usually let you see the body, but I can be damn convincin’ when I want to be. Don’t even remember what I told ‘em, really. I don’t wanna consider what it means, that I can lie to the people who help me so effortlessly that I forget the lie itself.
<br><br>
Some things ain’t worth thinkin’ about. Not if you wanna stay some semblance of sane.
<br><br>
The room had one small camera, but the light was off. Dead. Expect some intern flipped the switch somewhere along the line. Weak stomach, weak will, couldn’t handle watchin’ the bodies get mulched so as to be turned into fresh, bright-eyed lambs to the slaughter. I’m sure, whoever it was, they didn’t last long. But their loss is my advantage.
<br><br>
I musta done <span style="font-style:normal">somethin’</span>. The warnin’ signs were all there. They weren’t bringin’ me back. I had fucked up one too many times. So if they did…
<br><br>
Ev said that the sacrifices were okay. That because we get brought back, we ain’t worth that much. I hated hearin’ it, truth told. Hated knowin’ that when they said “we,” they counted themself among that number. That valueless mass. But that ain’t right.
<br><br>
We lose somethin’ every time. Memories don’t come that cheap. And that’s why I was there, surrounded by corpses, the smell seeping sickly-sweet down my nose and into my lungs, like death was tryin’ to make a home in my chest. It didn’t take much searchin’ to find what I was lookin’ for.
<br><br>
They’d taken the hardsuit off me, of course. Everythin’ material is valuable, even damaged. This was, I reflected, the second time in relatively short order that I had looked down at my own mangled corpse. It was in worse shape, this time, for certain. Blunt impact had ripped a hole in it—in me?—and entrails slid pink and black onto the smooth blue floor. It is a strange thin’, to count your own shattered ribs. But even lookin’ at the wretched thin’, I found myself calm. Why was that? Because, at least, this time it was really me? At least this time, I hadn’t…
<br><br>
...but I had. I knew that I had. I just didn’t know who was on the receivin’ end. I had a guess on how to figure it out, though.
<br><br>
It was a long shot, I knew that as I crouched down, tugged on the collar of the torn an’ bloodied jumpsuit. Small miracles, its/my neck an’ chest were mostly intact. I rolled up my sleeves an’ pressed a hand into the hollow where throat meets clavicle, and instead of touchin’ flesh, I touched nothin’ at all.
<br><br>
We think we know what nothin’ is like until we really encounter it. First few times I used the implant, I nearly threw up from the shock of it. Even sensory deprivation can’t encapsulate the everythin’ that nothin’ is. There is still air, temperature, small shifts in the world. But this was nothin’, until my hands brushed against a small selection of items. One was inconsequential: The implanter was expected. The rest, however…
<br><br>
The pair of blue cuffs, stained dark purple where the blood had dried (which was…most of ‘em, truth told), were one answer.* Dead *dead, then. I pushed down the twinge of disgust. Were they found? Did someone have to console the fleshy pink mass of brain tissue left behind, apologize for not bein’ there? I knew what that was like. I wanted to hate myself for doin’ it to someone else, but…
<br><br>
They can be brought back. They don’t matter.
<br><br>
Pain can be forgotten. Small, ugly consolations.
<br><br>
The next item was a pair of black gloves. I sighed. Typical, really. But what was taken?
<br><br>
The answer lay in the final item: a yellow headset. The bile rose in my throat then. Someone close, someone close, someone close. I needed to find out who. Could ask Ev, they had the memory for this shit. And surely it wasn’t them. Right?
<br><br>
And then I looked closer. Saw the dark, broken hair curled around one of the wires.
<br><br>
I need to talk to Everett.
