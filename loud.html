      Bets sits languidly at the bar, sipping at his drink. It always tastes
      better, he thinks, when the person making it doesn’t even have to ask him
      what he wants. He’s getting used to this, to being <em>known</em>, and he
      thinks he might like it. <br /><br />
      The station announcement rings sonorously through his headset. The shuttle
      has been called. And there, out of the corner of his vision, movement
      stops. Ace has frozen, for just a moment, before returning to the motions
      of tending the bar, but Bets knows what that moment means. Recognizes the
      small calculations running behind his pale eyes.
      <br /><br />
      Time is running out, and he has a job to do.
      <br /><br />
      This is why, when he sees him dragging the body, he knows. Everyone else
      sees it as a sympathetic act, good fortune leading him to a tragic
      accident. Bets is unconvinced. But he also thinks it strange, that hands
      that had cut him open so carefully would carry out such rushed work. And
      something on Ace’s face looks <em>wrong</em>, distraught in a way that
      Bets has not seen in him before. And there is a drive, something he is not
      sure he recognizes (there is care, yes, but also the need to know, to
      understand another facet of the one person who has seen all of what he is
      without flinching) that pulls him into maints behind him. <br /><br />
      <em>“Y’know,”</em> he says, hoarse voice fading into the hiss of pipes
      around them. <em>“You’re lucky I don’t wanna shoot you either.”</em> He
      waits for a laugh that does not come. Instead, Ace looks down at hands
      that shake, and says: <br /><br />
      <em>“It’s so</em> loud<em>.”</em> <br /><br />
      Bets flinches, ever so slightly. Old, familiar music plays in his ears for
      just a moment, one haunting measure. Slowly, carefully, he reaches out and
      loops an arm around the man’s shoulders and pulls him into something
      clumsily resembling a hug.
      <br /><br />
      <em>“I know,”</em> is all he says. <em>“I know.”</em>
    </p>
    <p class="quote">///</p>
    <p>
      The comms key rests on the purple-trimmed tile outside of the science
      department. Bets leans forward and picks it up, noting the small wrench
      insignia upon it as he slots it into his headset. He glances down the
      hall, but no one is there. The intercom Ace had used sits abandoned, and
      everything is quiet save for the quiet tap of his shoes and the whisper of
      his tail dragging behind him as he walks.
      <br /><br />
      The station is big. Too big for so few people. Normally, he would find the
      isolation somewhat distressing, too much of a chance to be alone with the
      ghosts that linger in most of these outposts, now. But this place is new,
      and he cannot see blood overlaying the stark, clean tile. Cannot see
      cracks in the windows, bullet casings on the floors. Cannot hear voices
      calling his name as he passes the other departments, full of need or
      desperation or raw fear. He has not ruined this place, yet. It is somewhat
      comforting, being somewhere he hasn’t broken.
      <br /><br />
      And besides, he is not really isolated, is he?
      <br /><br />
      He trudges back into the artifact lab, glaring at the alien shape on the
      other side of the glass. A holocarp lies dead in the corner, scales
      undulating in a way that makes him feel a little bit sick to his stomach.
      He steps carefully around the blood on the floor (his own), and gingerly
      lifts it by its shimmering tail before walking it to the disposals bin.
      The gashes on the backs of his hands are mostly knit closed, now, just
      fading cracks in the scale that will linger until his next shed. He shrugs
      to himself, and goes back to work, waiting for a call that does not take
      long to come.
      <br /><br />
      <em>“D-doing?”</em> A whisper through his headset. <br /><br />
      Bets narrows his eyes at the artifact, resisting the unwise urge to give
      it a swift kick. <em>“Cussin’ out artis,”</em> he replies.
      <em>“Not much.”</em> He pauses, but there is only dead air. Hesitation?
      <em>“Need somethin’?”</em> he asks. <em>“Or…want?”</em> <br /><br />
      Ace gives a quiet <em>“Mm”</em> in response. More silence.
      <em>“W-wond-dering…”</em> <br /><br />
      Bets chuckles. <em>“Dangerous thing, that.”</em> <br /><br />
      <em>“Still loud,”</em> says a quiet voice. Bets hums thoughtfully to
      himself, a low-toned growl that rumbles through his chest.
      <em>“Nobody else t-t-to…tell.”</em> <br /><br />
      <em>“There’s a smaller bar, off to the west,”</em> Bets says, already
      moving towards the door. <em>“If you wanna meet somewhere more…”</em> He
      frowns. <em>“I don’t wanna say</em> quiet <em>but…”</em> <br /><br />
      <em>“Haveta watch th-the tesla.”</em>
      <br /><br />
      Bets pauses, out in the hallway.
      <em>“...Want me to brin’ somethin’ to you?”</em> There is a shaky intake
      of breath, and then a response that strikes Bets as something…not out of
      character. But new, for the person on the other end of the comms channel.
      <br /><br />
      <em>“P-please?”</em>
      <br /><br />
      Bets smiles, and walks toward the bar.
    </p>
    <p class="quote">///</p>
    <p>
      Bets wipes the condensation from the iced coffee glass onto his jumpsuit. Ace looks at it, something complex (gratitude? Confusion? Anxiety?) rolling across his face before he takes a sip. He looks distant, eyes fixed on a point somewhere off to the right.
<br /><br />
<em>“Sorry,”</em> he says, and Bets shakes his head.
<br /><br />
<em>“For what?”</em> Bets asks, even though he already knows the answer. It’s an apology he has given too many times: for wanting—for needing—an anchor. <em>“Nothin’ to be sorry for.”</em> Ace grumbles, almost inaudibly, and shuffles his feet. Bets’s ear twitches, catching the sound.
<br /><br />
<em>“Yeah, yeah,”</em> he says, the mockery gentle. <em>“Oh noooo, I had an excuse to go to the bar. End of the world.”</em> Ace still won’t look at him, but a ghost of a smile flickers across his mouth. Bets steps slightly closer. <em>“Where do you wanna be?”</em>
<br /><br />
Ace hums in thought, a rasp that sounds as if it gets stuck in his throat. His gaze clears, landing upon the doors to Atmospherics. <em>“T-trying to f-figure out the TEG here.”</em> Bets cocks his head, genuine interest piquing his curiosity. Pipes and wires are problems to solve, and as much as he is here to help his friend, it is somewhat of a relief to be faced with a more tangible puzzle.
<br /><br />
<em>“Haven’t seen the setup here myself,”</em> he murmurs. <em>“Lyin’ if I said I wasn’t curious.”</em> Ace nods, a little shakily, and for a moment Bets thinks he isn’t going to move. But eventually, jerkily, he does, leading him through a maze of unfamiliar halls and tunnels. Eventually, they emerge into a small room snaked with pipes, which Ace glares at with the kind of malice he seems to reserve for the inanimate.
<br /><br />
<em>“Conv-voluted,”</em> he grumbles, kicking a stray pipe, which clatters loudly across the floor. He looks poised to say more, to start solving the problem in front of him, but something moves through him and he takes a shaky breath. He stares down at his hands. They, too, shake. Just barely.
<br /><br />
Bets glances over at him, following his line of sight. Looks away, back towards the empty burn chamber, and says, <em>“Look. I ain’t gonna make you say anythin’ you don’t wanna. But…”</em> He thinks. Of chords and crescendos and violent tones that vibrate through his bloodstream and ring in his ears. <em>“It gets loud for me, too. And it’s hell.”</em> He looks down at the ground, ears swivelling back to block out noise that isn’t there. His soft voice whispers even more softly, <em>“I know it’s hell. And I know it…wants an outlet. Badly.”</em>
<br /><br />
Ace’s voice quivers. Some might mistake it for one holding back tears, but Bets knows that what he is struggling to keep at bay is something much more vicious. <em>“I-it won’t…go away.”</em> He stares wide-eyed, straight ahead, unfocused. <em>“I-I… I did wh-what they…”</em> His breathing comes ragged. <em>“I did it all.”</em>
<br /><br />
Bets holds the silence, thinking. A wiser man would have words of comfort, but he can’t offer anything that Ace needs to hear, because he hasn’t been able to find words that are enough to comfort <em>himself</em>. So he just…speaks.
<br /><br />
<em>“I wonder, sometimes. How much of it is what they want me to do, an’ how much of it is somethin’ I’ve wanted to do all along.”</em> He grimaces. <em>“Sorry. I know that…doesn’t help much.”</em> He laughs bitterly. <em>“But if nothin’ else. I get it.”</em> Ace nods, his gaze softening slightly.
<br /><br />
<em>“It’s a-al-always h-hard to…know. If it’s s-something I want, or what</em> they <em>want.”</em>
<br /><br />
Bets turns to face him, hands loose at his sides. Knowing he’s wide open, and the other man has tools (what could he do with a drill, with a crowbar, with hands that crave blood?). <em>“I’d tell ya to just come at me swingin’. Get it outta your system. But…”</em> He rubs his jaw idly. <em>“I think if it’s anythin’ like what it is for me, it don’t work if there’s permission. It wants to take. It doesn’t want anythin’ freely given.”</em>
<br /><br />
Ace raises a hand, still shaky, and waves it. So-so. <em>“W-want is weird.”</em> He rubs his neck, fingers tracing across the fine line that marks it. <em>“I th-think a lot…”</em> His voice breaks, words lost in the hisses of pain that escape him as he speaks. <em>“Is w-want…or need… I n-need…”</em> He coughs sharply. <em>“Do I need? To hurt? Or is it what they w-want me to need?”</em> He looks, for a moment, almost sad. Like a child losing something treasured behind him on the road, and the car won’t turn around. <em>“Do I want to…hurt?”</em>
<br /><br />
<em>“I think… I’ve stopped askin’ myself that, really.”</em> Bets’s hands flutter, searching for purpose, eventually coming to rest in his pockets. <em>“Because it’s fluid.”</em> He hears the faint wheeze beside him as Ace tries to calm himself, steady his breathing. Calm the thing that pounds in his ears. And Bets cannot fix it for him, so he just keeps talking. <em>“Wants become needs because they eat at us. Needs become wants because, in order to fulfill ‘em, we have to</em> want <em>to. Same coin.”</em> He flicks his ear. Ace, his breathing as steady as it can be, now, nods again.
<br /><br />
<em>“You can,”</em> Bets says, glancing up at him, <em>“start swingin’. I don’t care.”</em> He laughs in a tone that rings hollow. <em>“Can’t feel it, anyways. Wouldn’t let me keep that.”</em>
<br /><br />
Ace frowns down at him, slightly. Not with anger, not with violence, but with something bordering on disappointment. <em>“I think what I need is less a p-punching bag, and more…”</em> He coughs, and stares down at his shoes. <em>“A friend? Right n-now, at least.”</em> He seems to choke on the words, but this time Bets suspects it has very little to do with the scarring on his throat. He chuckles to himself.
<br /><br />
<em>“I can manage that,”</em> he replies. <em>“I just…”</em> He rubs the bridge of his nose. <em>“I keep findin’ myself in these situations where the solution isn’t me</em> doin’ <em>somethin’. It’s me just</em> bein’<em>. And that’s…confusin’, for a person like me.”</em> And here, Ace smiles slightly, nudging Bets with his elbow, causing him to crack a small grin of his own. <em>“But I can be a friend. Already was, in my books. But…”</em> He laughs. <em>“Like I said. Stuck with me. So…here I am.”</em>
<br /><br />
<em>“I’ll kick your ass a-another day,”</em> Ace quips, and while his tone is hushed and flat, Bets has heard enough of it that he can tell something has returned to it that the noise had stripped away. He grins crookedly.
<br /><br />
<em>“You better,”</em> he retorts, and looks down at the gold band on Ace’s finger. <em>“It</em> is <em>a nice ring. Wouldn’t kill me to wear it a while.”</em> His face twists.
<br /><br />
<em>“It is! But d-don’t th-think I’m getting attached to it,”</em> Ace says, and the two look each other in the eyes for just a moment (it is always violence that breaks that wall), and say at the same time:
<br /><br />
<em>“Bad wordin’. It would literally kill me.”</em><br>
<em>“A-actually, it</em> would <em>kill you to wear it a while.”</em>
<br /><br />
And both laugh, and perhaps both are mad, but neither particularly cares, now.
<br /><br />
An alert interrupts them. Space debris. Ace coughs and rubs his throat, and Bets looks away until he has recovered. <em>“I can wait here, if you need to fix that,”</em> he says, but Ace shakes his head.
<br /><br />
<em>“F-fuck that noise.”</em> Bets chuckles hoarsely, and the conversation turns, meandering through discussion of containment, teslas, debris. Atmos setups, plasma chambers, and, finally, back to the TEG. Ace is glowering at the mess of pipes once again, and Bets pipes up with the observation—
<br /><br />
<em>“I think this sucks.”</em> Ace nods, and Bets sighs.
<br /><br />
<em>“Really, r-really does. B-but it gives me s-something to…be angry at.”</em> Ace’s glare remains, but it feels almost forced, a mask meant to hide something <em>else</em>.
<br /><br />
Bets scratches at his throat. <em>“Need that, some days.”</em> Ace doesn’t turn away from the pipes, but nods, dark hair sticking up at odd angles like he’s run his hands through it in contemplation. Bets glances in his direction, then back away, mulling over his words and promptly giving up on any hope of eloquence. Just says <em>“Thank you. For talkin’ to me. I know that’s…weird.”</em> Ace’s gaze shifts, staring down at his shoes as he twitches, just a little, fighting off nervous movement. <em>“But it helps knowin’ that I ain’t the only one whose head gets loud an’ violent.”</em> He tilts his chin up, and while one man looks at the ground, the other stares towards a sky that isn’t there.
<br /><br />
Another nod, but it is stilted, shaky. Ace’s voice, which Bets did not think could get quieter than it already has, does, and his ears swivel, fighting to hear the words. <em>“I d-don’t l-like how loud it g-gets.”</em> And there is a wave of sympathy, but also gratitude, that washes through Bets, because someone else knows. And this is something given (blood in the water).
<br /><br />
<em>“Neither do I,”</em> he replies, and then offers something in return: <em>“It’s music, for me.”</em> His ears twitch, fighting off ghosts of screaming sound. <em>“It’s awful, discordant music that screeches off-key, an’ it won’t fuckin’ stop. Until there’s blood.”</em> He feels the way that the shudder moves through his bones, but it is not something he can fight. There are too many memories, crawling like maggots under his skin, of gunshots and breaking bones and the sound it makes when a bullet opens a hole in someone’s flesh. <em>“And then it’s beautiful,”</em> he whispers. <em>“And I hate it.”</em>
<br /><br />
<em>“It’s…”</em> Ace trails off. Speaks slowly, as if he’s afraid that the words themselves will burn, ignite the air, send Bets running. <em>“...colours. Red and hot.”</em> There is a knowledge in his eyes, and where so many others would carry pity, there is only a plea to <em>stay, stay, stay</em>. So Bets stays rooted to the spot as he says <em>“L-like my mind is on fire.”</em>
<br /><br />
He says his head is full of fire, and while fire has only ever spoken of fear and loss before today, there is a strange kind of comfort in it now that catches Bets off guard. Because they are both full of fire, aren’t they? And it wants to consume them and destroy everything around them, but neither is alone in it.
<br /><br />
But all of that is too complex for him to force into words and phrases now, and all he can force out is <em>“Interestin’.”</em>
<br /><br />
Ace is unphased by his brevity, speaking like the words have been pressure building in his throat, a torrent now that they’ve found an opening. Maybe they are, have been trapped, need release. <em>“A-and I feel s-s-simultaneously…out of control, not like my-myself, and more myself th-than I’ve ev-ever been.”</em>
<br /><br />
Bets laughs, and it is bitter. He thinks of conversations about control, something he fights to keep, to hold. Something Everett sometimes wishes they could lose. He will not say their name, not to Ace, not to this person who he both trusts with his entire being and distrusts with everyone else’s. But he will say <em>“I have a friend, who’s… Well. They fight real hard to keep things under control, and it mostly works. And the few times they’ve done…</em> work<em>, it’s been to let go of that control.”</em> Ace chuckles knowingly, and the smile on Bets’s face is a little sad, because he hates to admit that there are parts of his family he does not understand, cannot understand, that <em>“I wanna say that I understand, but I don’t.”</em> The admission is a knife twisting, but there is some healing in the bloodletting. Weight lifted, weight shared. <em>“Because I constantly feel like I am two steps from flyin’ off the handle, until I have a gun in my hands. And I know who I am, an’ what I’m doin’, an’ exactly how to…</em> be<em>, I guess.”</em> There is a small sigh from beside him. <em>“And it’s the most in control I get to feel.”</em>
<br /><br />
Ace lets out a small <em>“Hmm.”</em> Gives Bets a momentary once-over, analytical, looking at his vulnerability with the same expression he wears while looking for breaches in hulls. <em>“I don’t think I really entirely kn-know when I’m in c-control…or</em> out <em>of control.”</em> Bets runs his claws over the scar tissue on his cheek, nervous habit flaring as the push and pull of vulnerability ebbs between them. <em>“I t-try not to think a-about it.”</em>
<br /><br />
<em>“I s’pose that makes sense. Prolly better not to.”</em> Bets wishes he could <em>stop</em> thinking about it. But if he stops thinking about it, lets his guard down, who becomes the collateral for that peace of mind?
<br /><br />
<em>“If I think a-about it…it…”</em> The words seem to take effort to force out. <em>“...just gets louder.”</em>
<br /><br />
And again, all Bets can say is <em>“I know.”</em> Because he does.
<br /><br />
And then there is a chime from Ace’s pocket, and he retrieves his PDA with a silent sigh, silencing the alarm with one deft movement.
<br /><br />
<em>“Tesla?”</em> Bets asks.
<br /><br />
<em>“Tesla,”</em> he confirms.
<br /><br />
And then the two are, once again, discussing the finer points of containment setups, conversation shifting from the violent to the technical with the ease of the tide moving in, going out. They twist back through the guts of the station, Bets lighting a cigarette while Ace welds the coils, and they emerge back into the front room of the department. Ace stares somewhat resignedly at the atmospheric alert computer, counting breaches on his fingers. Work beckons, but he looks something <em>approaching</em> relaxed, and Bets thinks that perhaps his most important job here today is already done.
<br /><br />
<em>“You’re lookin’ better,”</em> he observes. Then quips, <em>“I blame the iced coffee.”</em> A grin stretches across his twisted maw, and Ace laughs, the melody of it lost to most (how fortunate he is, Bets thinks, to be able to hear the music of it).
<br /><br />
<em>“S-surely it was just the coffee that d-did the trick.”</em> He coughs slightly, but smiles through it.
<br /><br />
<em>“Prolly.”</em> Bets returns the volley. <em>“I’m just here to talk over all the other shit.”</em> He sticks his tongue out, and Ace returns the gesture before his face settles into something contemplative, and a little embarrassed. He shifts.
<br /><br />
<em>“Th-thank you, though.”</em>
<br /><br />
Bets nods. <em>“Of course.”</em>
<br /><br />
<em>“We’re…”</em> Ace smirks a little, the expression a touch bemused. <em>“Weird friends. But I-I’m glad we are. F-friends.”</em>
<br /><br />
<em>“Me too,”</em> Bets says, and means it. There is something here that is vital to him, and it <em>is</em> weird, but normalcy is a rarity for most in their line of work. And besides, what about <em>him</em> has ever been normal? <em>“I think… I mean, we’re weirder than most, but my closest friends ‘sides you are a cannibal an’ someone who…”</em> Dark, curly hair, a face painted over with detachment. <em>“Tends to dissociate through their friends’ murderous rampages. So…”</em> He shrugs. <em>“It’s all weird”</em>
<br /><br />
<em>“Quite the s-s-selection you’ve got.”</em>
<br /><br />
<em>“Ain’t nobody normal after enough time out here.”</em>
<br /><br />
And then, there is another ping, another alert, another flash on the monitor. Ace grumbles, then whispers, <em>“Th-think it’s t-time we go b-back to doing our j-jobs?”</em>
<br /><br />
<em>“Maybe,”</em> Bets says, then frowns up at him. He’s muttering about space dust, scrolling through a handheld map, when Bets says, <em>“Lean forward.”</em> His movement pauses.  <em>“I am gonna give you brain damage,”</em> Bets says, in a tone he hopes is reassuring.
<br /><br />
<em>“Wh-why?”</em> Ace asks, clearly baffled, hesitant.
<br /><br />
<em>“Lizard hug,”</em> Bets rumbles. <em>“But you are too fuckin’ tall for it.”</em> Ace cocks his head, still uncertain, but leans over slightly. Grinning like mad, Bets winds up and smacks his forehead off of Ace’s. He cackles as the other man straightens, rubbing the slight red mark it leaves behind. <em>“Lizard hug,”</em> he repeats, smacking his tail off the ground to punctuate the statement.
<br /><br />
<em>“Wh-what the fuck,”</em> Ace asks, through laughter of his own. <em>“That’s not a hug.”</em>
<br /><br />
Bets is turning to leave, clapping his hands together, and saying <em>“Yes it is!”</em> when Ace continues with <em>“That’s brain damage.</em> This <em>is a hug.”</em> And while it is brief, Bets is abruptly pulled in by the same arms that dragged him through Amber’s halls.
<br /><br />
<em>“Smartass,”</em> he mutters.
<br /><br />
<em>“Shithead,”</em> Ace replies. They grin at each other, all teeth.
<br /><br />
The two leave the department. Bets points at the portal yawning to their left. <em>“You need anythin’, that goes to science front,”</em> he says. Ace nods. He thumps his tail. And the two part ways, strange friends, but friends nonetheless.
