It's always fire. 
<br><br>
It is fire when your teacher watches you burn, slowly, feeling the way that your flesh splits, the blood evaporating as it seeps out of the cracks in your hardsuit. It is fire now when the kindest person in your world is reduced to ash on the cryobed because you weren't smart enough, weren't fast enough, were never enough to keep up with everything that [was] [is] [will be] good in them. 
<br><br>
It brings them in as you are standing over a body. Your hands aren't shaking. You feel like they should be. She died in pain thinking you were there to HELP her. They all thought you could do some fucking good, and her blood is a scarlet expanse over the floor because you used the things that they (all that good) gave you to heal as a weapon. Later, one of the others will tell you that maybe it would be better if they didn't bring you back. You will think that you agree. 
<br><br>
But you selfish, tepid thing. You want to live. 
<br><br>
The last time they brought you out of the pod, your postmortem said that you died bravely. But is it really bravery when it is done only to ensure that someone lives on to remember you? When you let the others burn in order to ensure that those few people you have let in are the sole survivors? What does that do to THEM? Do you care? Or is it just enough that some part of you will survive the collapse of your flesh and your blood and of all of the things that pulse through your body, allowing it to take step after self-serving step?
<br><br>
They thought you could help people. But you can't save anyone. Not yourself, not them. And now they are gone, and the bow scrapes discordant once more against violent strings. 
<br><br>
You did what you had to. You tell yourself that this, too, is a necessity. But it's not. One death would have been enough for them. You're doing this because the hurt screams through you, a gunshot over the sound of a symphony, all the brave and the beautiful and the good silenced, head flung back, an arc of scarlet splashed across the orchestra.
<br><br>
It is all so loud, and it is all your fault, and someone else needs to feel it. And the door is wide open. 
<br><br>
You're doing this because you want to. 
<br><br>
She sees you and the fear in her eyes sparks something in you (a fire, a fire, a fire). It feels right. She should be afraid. You are a weapon, your blade-sharp edges too ragged to serve their purpose as a scalpel, suited only to be DRAGGED ACROSS A THROAT. They both look at you like a monster, and you are, and it feels GOOD.
<br><br>
You wonder, later, when they leave you alone with the stars and the cigarette smoke, when the tears come, if it's better that they won't remember you like this. That they didn't have to see. But it's not. You would rather them remember you as a monster than risk them forgetting you as anything else. 
<br><br>
You've been getting greedy. Fire is just how the universe balances the scales.
