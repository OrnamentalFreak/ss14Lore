    <p>
You wake up in a security hardsuit with lungs full of ash. They don't want you to remember (Epsilon, nukies, the roaring in your ears). But they can't take YOUR memories away, can they? They ask what you know, what you saw. You spit in their faces. Your death is not merciful, but it is quick. And you see it through the eyes of the one who plunges the syringe into your veins in the moments before you reawaken. 
<br><br>
They reduce your mind to a drive, encode time and sentiment into bytes of data. Say it's for review, to tie up loose ends. They think that their locks are enough, but you have puppetmasters in high places. And they know that anger is what fuels you. So why not twist the knife?
<br><br>
And you remember. You shouldn't, not so clearly. But how do you forget the look on their face, fire-haloed, as they pulled you close and burnt to nothing in your arms?
<br><br>
All that they are, were, remaining only as the taste of ash in your mouth. You were gonna give them the suit. Why couldn't you be faster?
<br><br>
Not all of the memories that tear through your mind are your own, though. And as much as you hate those bitter, stolen fragments of self that invade your mind, rebuilding the friends you have lost, this time… This time, you are grateful. Because while you were too slow, while you could have saved them, their blood is not on your hands alone.
<br><br>
Once again, their eyes are yours, staring down the barrel of a gun. Once again, there is black and red on the other side. But this time, it is a security officer, and he is screaming, demanding the orange and white suit meant to save THEM. 
<br><br>
(You also see through the eyes of another, the eyes of a friend. A friend who takes his helmet off, and in the same voice that promised you that he couldn’t kill them, begs them to run. You try not to think about it. He tried. But he still armed the bomb, didn’t he? Still condemned you both to this ending? You don’t think about it, because you’re scared that it could just as easily have been you.)
<br><br>
And what are they going to do? It is the certainty of the gun versus the potentiality of the void. And then you find them, one airlock between the two of you and space, the detonation ringing through the halls as it rips them apart. No matter what you do, there is no escape, now. They do not recognize you, at first. Simply say “Good luck,” because they know you might make it. You want to bite your tongue, want to spare them the knowledge that you will outlive them, because you know that the only thing worse than being the sole survivor is knowing the weight that you leave behind with your martyrdom. 
<br><br>
But you can’t. You don’t want them to think that they’re dying in the arms of a stranger. 
<br><br>
<em>“Sorry,”</em> is all you can choke out, the heat pulling the tears off of your face the moment that they fall. And while you can’t feel it through the suit, you see the way that they shift around you, clinging to you like a life raft. But you are full of holes, empty spaces, and the water rushing in drags you both down.
<br><br>
Until you wake up. And you are <em>angry</em>.
<br><br>
There is music in your ears, and for the first time, it is a welcome friend.
