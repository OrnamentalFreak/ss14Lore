<strong>11:00</strong>
<br><br>
You wake up.
<br><br>
Light bleeds the red of pulsing veins through your eyelids. You groan, more out of habit than anything, third eyelids coming unstuck with a familiar discomfort. You sit, body protesting through stiffness and fatigue, but not pain. Never pain. Pain is an old, forgotten friend. Pain is a lover who stopped writing a long time ago. You stay there, caught on the threshold between half-asleep and half-awake, until the birdsong piping through your room cuts off mid-stanza, looping back around to its first notes. 
<br><br>
You flick your ears. The irritatingly familiar chords are enough to propel you fully out of bed, cursing as you stumble over a bottle still half-full. It calls to you, and you bend down to scoop it up, sending your vision into a tailspin. You lurch toward the window with its too-thin blinds, fumbling around under the windowsill until your fingers meet the switch tucked away in its shadow. The birdsong stops. 
<br><br>
The bottle and the bed beckon, but their siren song is not one you can acquiesce to today. You've got shit to do. You take one small sip, letting the vodka run warm down your throat, and set it down. Despite knowing what you'll find, you pull the blinds away from the glass, memories of trees and skies and fields and <em>life</em> dragging you down like a thousand phantom limbs. All you find is light, a screen perfectly calibrated to mimic the almost-noon sunlight. 
<br><br>
The window leads to nothing at all. 
<br><br>
<strong>12:00</strong>
<br><br>
The cigarette lights in one fluid motion. How quickly your fumbling has been smoothed out, how quickly the smoke that used to send you into fits of coughing has learned to settle velvet-soft in your lungs. Some of it drifts through the gap in your lip, gentle heat stirring memories of flame. Ash drops to the floor of the balcony, and you watch the way it sits, unmoving.
<br><br>
These are the fragments of your ghosts that you can control. You bring the fear, the poison, into yourself. Inhale. Exhale. Let it go. The sense of control it affords you is an illusion, you know that. You are still rendered helpless in the face of real flame, still can’t set foot on *that* station without the smell of burning flesh in your nose and on the back of your tongue. Still can’t look at a burn chamber without seeing your own face in the glass, skin sloughing off and crisping and—
<br><br>
Inhale. Exhale. Let it go.
<br><br>
The cherry-red ember draws ever closer to your fingertips, and you stub it out before it can give you any fresh scars. You stretch, joints popping, and feel *almost* alive. Glancing towards the other side of the small platform, you are met with a wall of green. The wall of planters is, perhaps, the one thing in this damned apartment that is *real*. You step inside, filling the small plastic watering can sitting by the sink. You could just leave the sprinkler system on, as you do when you are sent on-station to work, but there is something about the act of keeping a living thing alive that grounds you. You move diligently from plant to plant: aloe, poppy, trumpet. Berries, juiced for drinks. Garlic you can’t eat, but you had the space for it, so you leave it in front of your neighbour’s door, who you never see but you can smell the food that they make every evening. Each of these and more, all dependent on you for survival, even if only in the moments that you’re around to see it.
<br><br>
Those moments are enough.
<br><br>
A flickering in the corner of your vision draws your attention, and you frown. One of the panels in the artificial sky is acting up again. You climb over the balcony railing, stepping out into the air over the street below. Instead of plummeting through it, it warps beneath your feet in a spray of pixels. You walk on air until you are directly beneath the faulty panel, stretch up as far as you can, and press your fingertips against it. It snaps back into place with a <em>click</em>, restoring the illusion that you are not trapped inside of a tiny box, one of a thousand packed into a dense hive. 
<br><br>
Right on cue, the artificial breeze stirs. The ashes are swept away.
<br><br>
<strong>1:00</strong>
<br><br>
Finally, finally, your stomach has settled enough to eat. 
<br><br>
You clear last night’s dishes off of the stove, grimacing as you add them to the pile already in the sink. Can’t keep putting it off, can you? (You can, you know you can. You always seem to find a way.) You root through your cupboards, unearthing the last pan still untouched by your procrastination, and set it on one of the elements. Open your fridge, largely empty, to retrieve a small pat of salted fat and a slab of artificial meat. The AgriGrow ProteinFab glows an unsettling pinkish-beige, and a “NUTRIMENT LOW” alert flashes on its screen alongside a small icon depicting a rather panicked-looking (but very much alive) cow. These machines are marketed as the *kind* solution, but realistically, their presence is nearly universal only because they are the cheap one, too. How rarely the two coincide.
<br><br>
The slab of not-meat hisses as it lands on the pan, and the smell is just so subtly wrong. You sigh. For all that NanoTrasen has fucked you over, at least they serve you real meat. They should start putting <em>that</em> on the applications.
<br><br>
<strong>2:00</strong>
<br><br>
The relative quiet is one thing that you always take for granted when you’re on the job. Even when it is torn through by the explosions, the meteors, the gunshots, at least it <em>exists</em>. Not so, here. The domestic hub has always been something that you’ve found overwhelming, but you didn’t want to be in your apartment any longer than you had to be, and you needed *movement*, so walking was the only option. You get a few annoyed glances as you step out onto the concrete, and you roll your eyes, but loop your tail up through the crook of your elbow regardless. There is never enough space here.
<br><br>
Couriers dart around you with mail bags. Some deliver packages through the pneumatic tubes nested into the sides of buildings like exposed arteries, others insert small drives into kiosk ports, uploading message data from faraway homes, from distant families, from station-side lovers. It is a small way to conserve power, the runners. People run cheaper than machines, nowadays, and data networks are vulnerable. So the truly important stuff is uploaded directly into personal feeds, as private as you can get on a corporate megastation.
<br><br>
You have never received one of those messages. There is no one out there for you.
<br><br>
You glance upward. Two suns, today. The simulation rotates through a handful of skies from the most-represented planets by population. It looks so familiar, but… 
<br><br>
You feel it, then, the way that recollection slides off of your mind like water. The world dims around you momentarily, and your heart rate spikes. There is a pounding in your temples. You need to get inside. Away from the sky that is both entirely familiar and unsettlingly foreign at the same time.
<br><br>
<strong>3:00</strong>
<br><br>
Cigarette butts litter the ashtray, most of them yours. The barista gives you a funny look, and you order another green tea not because you want one, but because you aren’t ready to go back out. Not yet. The screen on the table flashes advertisements for products that all start to blur together (make you better, stronger, more beautiful, more <em>yourself</em>), which you dismiss idly while pulling up transit information. You need to get to the next hub over, and those trams run only intermittently. End of shift, usually, to carry the drunks and the addicts and those seeking dangerous entertainment. You have been all three. Are still all three to varying degrees, if you’re being honest with yourself.
<br><br>
But tonight, you are pursuing a different kind of high. You are providing the fix, not consuming it, for once in your life.
<br><br>
The next departure is in half an hour. You glance out the window you have been trying to ignore. Still busy, still throbbing with life. But you need to move. You drink the tea a little too quickly, making that same barista frown, but you can’t feel the heat anyways. 
<br><br>
You take a deep breath, and step outside.
<br><br>
<strong>4:00</strong>
<br><br>
Stars surge past the window like bright wounds in the dark. You can’t stop watching.
<br><br>
Much as you hate the city, you adore the trams. They move through the great glass network that links hub to hub, and the view that blinks past too quickly to really process it is the only thing that you have to remind you of where you really are. Why let you see it now? You’ve always wondered (though, really, always is relative). It must be to remind you of the isolation, you think. That for all of their illusions of light, and freedom, and vibrancy, you are all alone out here if they decide to pull the plug.
<br><br>
They are everything, and you are nothing.
<br><br>
You fish through your pocket, removing a small blue stone. The glow of the crystal has dulled some, but it still paints your palm in cyan. You wrap your fist around it. Your good luck. The walls close in once again, the tram plunged into darkness save for the faint blue seeping out from between your fingers. Fluorescent lights snap on. The doors hiss open. You crack your neck.
<br><br>
Time to make something of yourself.
<br><br>
<strong>5:00</strong>
<br><br>
This hub is <em>different</em>. You let your tail slide across the sidewalk freely, hands hanging loosely by your sides, but your eyes skim the many twisting alleyways around you. It is never truly safe here, but you know that that, too, is by design. People do not cling to authority without the presence of danger. You allow yourself a slight grin. Perhaps you, too, feed into that system. 
<br><br>
But being the danger is <em>fun</em>.
<br><br>
Pyrrha told you how to get here after the bar fight. Whispered instructions, headsets clutched in closed fists. You navigate the complex web of streets, brushing past seedy bars that you know are filled to the brim with cameras and mics and loose tongues. This is just the surface, the facade meant to lure rats into traps primed to snap closed on little bodies until they stop thrashing. One more turn. A dead end. You move towards it, slipping through the projection of a worn, graffitied brick wall into a maintenance tunnel that reeks of rot and piss. 
<br><br>
<em>This</em> is something real. It’s allowed to be because <em>they</em> have forgotten it. Not as omniscient as they’d like you to believe, are they?
<br><br>
The tunnel leads down, down, so far into the bowels of the machine-city that something primal and claustrophobic rooted deep in your psyche screams for you to turn back towards the surface. But you press on just a little further, and the heartbeat of music starts to rise through the catwalks, beckoning you forward as it crawls through your bones.
<br><br>
Another crooked grin. You’ve arrived.
<br><br>
<strong>6:00</strong>
<br><br>
They want you to rig the match. You laugh.  Most of the organizers learn pretty quickly, but this one is stubborn. They hiss and spit, and beckon to the two guards stationed by the doors of your changeroom: A dirty, well-used cupboard of a place, really, now filled with a haze of smoke from the cigarette clenched between your teeth. They aren’t supposed to show any emotion, helps keep the fighters in check, but one of them lets a small grin twist her face. 
<br><br>
“You ain’t gonna win this one,” she says, a little drunkenly, which explains it.
<br><br>
“Then why the fuck do we keep him around?”
<br><br>
“Boss says he puts on a good show,” the other guard murmurs, casting a reproachful glare at the first.
<br><br>
“Boss is right,” she continues, warning unheeded.
<br><br>
“You heard ‘em,” you hiss. “Go bother someone else now, hmm? I got a fight to get ready for.”
<br><br>
They simply stand for a moment, before spitting some curses in another language (you understand, of course, but the knowledge is dragged back under the surface again before you can bother committing them to memory). They leave the room, and the serious guard gives you a curt nod before following them out. The other gives you a cocky salute, shutting the door behind her.
<br><br>
You pull your shirt over your head. The cracked mirror does not do enough to distort your reflection, but you’ve grown more used to it, at least. The burns crawl over much of your right side, and you move to run your hand over the much fresher scar on your left shoulder (dragon, you were told. Mean bastard. Meaner than you, apparently, because it came out on the winning side of the scrape). You strip down the rest of the way, opting for a loose-fitting pair of drawstring pants. You reach for the accompanying shirt, but your hand stops, hovering over the fabric. Fuck it. Let them see the scars.
<br><br>
Might work in your favour here, anyways.
<br><br>
<strong>7:00</strong>
<br><br>
He goes down too easily. <em>This</em> is who they wanted you to lose to?
<br><br>
He tries, sure, but the man seems to think that his size will afford him an easy victory. He is wrong. If you were fighting with rules, then maybe he’d have a chance, but there are no rules here. Which is not to say that the fight is <em>unfair</em>. He could have prepared, could have snuck glass shards into his wristwraps (you’ve seen it done, and while it’s lost its novelty some, it at least makes the fights more interesting for you). But you have teeth and claws, and his blood runs slick over the fightmaster’s hand as he raises your arm in victory.
<br><br>
You can see the organizers muttering amongst themselves, and a few angry faces in the crowd. One man pushes his way through the tangle of people, pulling aside the one from your changeroom earlier. They clearly had a deal. You chuckle. It’s never something you’ve understood: rigged fights, rigged decks, rigged odds. There’s no fun in that.
<br><br>
Your victory has obviously thrown the schedule into disarray, which delights you. It’s gonna piss them off, which in turns suggests that they’ll get <em>mean</em>. You like mean. Mean gives you a <em>challenge</em>.
<br><br>
<strong>8:00</strong>
<br><br>
You feel the air leave your lungs in one sharp bark as you hit the mat. You grin as you struggle to pull in oxygen, rolling out of the way of the sharp kick that lands where your head was moments before.
<br><br>
What <em>fun</em>!
<br><br>
The moth that they’ve pitted you against is fast, and she clearly has a wealth of CQC training. The way she carries herself, the way she moves, reminds you of a friend. Marines, probably. You are snapped out of your theorizing as you propel yourself to your feet, and instincts you should not have tell you to twist to your right. The elbow that soars past you sends a breeze (a real one, this time, fueled by motion and violent intent) across your face. Something in your brain catches. 
<br><br>
This is your opening. 
<br><br>
You let your momentum carry you, and you reach up, claws wrapping around her arm tightly enough that you feel her exoskeleton crack slightly. She hisses, and it is electric, raw adrenaline carrying you as you propel her up and through the air. She hits the cage with a crunch. You roll onto the balls of your feet as you watch for movement, ready to launch yourself forward. However, as her broken body bleeds grey-green onto the mats, she raises two fingers and taps the space on her chest where a collarbone might be, if she had one. 
<br><br>
Tapping out. 
<br><br>
The audience groans. The blood spilled is not enough. You glare out at them. There is no shame in knowing when to quit, you think. You just hope that the generosity in the sentiment outweighs the hypocrisy. 
<br><br>
<strong>9:00</strong>
<br><br>
You've REALLY got them spitting mad, now. 
<br><br>
You stalk your opponent in a circle around the ring. His feral smile matches your own, though his is whole, not broken into a lopsided sneer. Strategies flash through your brain. Go for the legs. For the eyes. Feint, feint now, feint NOW—
<br><br>
But no. This is yours. You push them aside, and rush him head-on. This is stupid, a misplay, a losing strategy. But DAMMIT it is YOURS. 
<br><br>
He laughs as he meets you with a hook that sends your head snapping to the side, only to be met with another punch directly to your jaw. You feel something pop, and when you leap backwards, your mouth won't close properly. Red spatters the white mat, mixing with the green, the brown, the blue. It's meant to stand out. It's what the audience wants. 
<br><br>
Now your instincts are screaming to run. You can run. You don't have to do this. 
<br><br>
Good. Should be enough to shut them up. Let the ghosts focus on such small things as self-preservation. This isn't their fight. 
<br><br>
<strong>It.</strong><br>
<strong>Is.</strong><br>
<strong>Yours.</strong>
<br><br>
Your opponent is not foolish enough to take your injury as a sign that his victory is assured. His tail flicks back and forth as he tenses. Injured animals are the most dangerous, after all. And that’s all you are, now. An animal. The world around you goes blurry, predator eyes focusing on the meat in front of you.
<br><br>
Finally, blessed silence. You are alone, you are in control, and you are <em>violent</em>.
<br><br>
Again, you move. Another mistake, sure, but you have long worn holes in the definition of insanity. And you are nothing if not lucky, because it throws the man (walking meat) off his guard, and your claws meet his shoulders, sinking into his flesh as you attempt to throw him to the floor. But he’s sturdy, and he tears himself away, quite literally: more scarlet, more gasps from the crowd, and all you can see of them are bared teeth (hungry, hungry, hungry; bleed for them). He kicks out, his heel meeting your ribcage, and you feel ribs crack. Your breathing comes ragged, and the blood that you cough up tells tales of a pierced lung. 
<br><br>
No pain. Just a flash of annoyance. The hunt is on a time limit, now.
<br><br>
You straighten, head cocking slightly. Your mind is quiet, and your prey looks almost afraid of your sudden composure, because he steps back slightly. You reach up, palming your crooked jaw. You push. <em>Snap</em>. You bare your teeth, joyous laughter bubbling up from your throat alongside another mouthful of blood. You spit off to the side, and before you have time to think, you move.
<br><br>
This is not instinct, it is *practice*. He is a mentor in an atmos suit, he is a soldier in a bloodred, he is a stranger in the wrong place at the wrong time, he is a friend who looks at you and—
<br><br>
Your freshly-fixed jaw closes around his throat. His thrashing doesn’t last long before he goes completely still. The crowd is rabid, raucous. They <em>adore</em> you. And in this moment, you adore <em>yourself</em>. This is not your purpose, this was not their design. 
<br><br>
This is all you.
<br><br>
<strong>10:00</strong>
<br><br>
“I’d ask if you need anything to numb you out, but I know the answer,” the doctor says with a sigh, withdrawing the needle from your arm.
<br><br>
“I don’t <em>nee</em>—”
<br><br>
“You don’t need it, but you’d still <em>like</em> it. We’ve done this song and dance enough, Bets. I’m not made of narcotics.” You sigh, and she rolls her eyes. “You’ll live,” she declares, and you nod, handing her a small stack of bills. A portion of your winnings, exchanged for a repaired body. 
<br><br>
You scratch your scarred cheek. “Speakin’ of livin’...” Your gaze slides towards the still body on the cryobed. 
<br><br>
“This again?”
<br><br>
“I thought we’d done this song an’ dance enough.”
<br><br>
“Mmhmm.” She taps a gloved finger against her leg. “Five thousand,” she says after some thought, and you nod, separating out a much larger stack of bills. She pockets it, and you know she’s overcharged you, but such are the costs of mercy. 
<br><br>
“He a debt-fighter?” you ask. She rubs her temples.
<br><br>
“If I tell you no, will you leave well enough alone?”
<br><br>
“What do you think?”
<br><br>
“I’d rather be doing anything *but* thinking about this,” she grumbles. There is a long silence before she continues. 
<br><br>
“Yes, he is. But you know if you keep doing this, the boss is gonna get upset. Debt-fighters are good viewing. Bring in a lotta sponsors. Sympathy pays, especially when it comes hand-in-hand with desperation.” 
<br><br>
You chuckle. “Well. If the boss wants me to stop doin’ this, he should start findin’ debt-fighters that can actually <em>win</em> against me.”
<br><br>
A glower. “That ego’s gonna get you in trouble one day.”
<br><br>
“One day? It’s <em>been</em> gettin’ me in trouble. I’m just a bad learner.” You grin crookedly.
<br><br>
When you leave the maints clinic, there are barely enough spesos in your pocket to cover tonight’s drinks. But that’s alright. You’ll make it work. And, you hope, so will the other guy.
<br><br>
<strong>11:00</strong>
<br><br>
A tram. Flecks of dried blood picked off of a small blue stone. Stars flying past.
<br><br>
<strong>12:00</strong>
<br><br>
You get home drunk enough that the walls keep moving on you, but not drunk enough to tamp down your disgust at being here again. But if you pass out at the bar, you wind up back in that medical facility, and that…
<br><br>
You don’t want to wake up there again. Not after the last time.
<br><br>
You hiss as you stumble into your bedroom. Left the damn light on. Of course you did. You sway-walk towards the switch, but you see someone in your peripheral vision, and the alcohol fog clears momentarily as you pivot towards it. 
<br><br>
The window, now projecting a facsimile of night, sits dark. And atop that darkness, your reflection.
<br><br>
You frown, and it frowns back. Scars and all.
<br><br>
You’re not sure what draws you towards it, towards that thing that is you but still so alien. You drag your eyes across it, even as your drink-blurred vision warps slightly. It is you. It is not.
<br><br>
<em>”It doesn’t matter. None of this is real.”</em>
<br><br>
But isn’t it? Isn’t this? Aren’t you?
<br><br>
You press your palm against the glass. It is solid, slightly too warm. Your reflection’s hand is raised to meet yours.
<br><br>
You are artificial. You are real. 
<br><br>
You crawl into bed and fall asleep.
