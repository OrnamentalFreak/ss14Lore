11.When Will They Learn?
</h3>

<em>One day, they will learn to hate you.</em>
<br><br>
Bets pushes the thought aside as he leverages the crowbar into the airlock, a growl rumbling in his chest as the exertion sends ghosts of sensation through his numbed nerves. His brain knows something should be there, but it isn't, leaving too much room for the phantoms in his skull. 
<br><br>
He has his fucked up little family, now. Everett. Molly. Those that drift through his orbit, familiar faces, Tye, Allen, Drafts. He wonders, so often, what it would take for them to give up on him. Knows how recently he wished that they would. But now, after so much stubbornness and refusal—
<br><br>
<em>"I know what the answer is gonna be, but I still have to ask: Will you Kindly fuck off and let me die alone?"</em>
<br><br>
<em>"No."</em>
<br><br>
—it has stoked a fire in him from kindling he did not know he possessed. He doesn't want to die. He doesn't want to be alone. 
<br><br>
Bets-It-All wants to be loved, and it's terrifying. 
<br><br>
Something in the airlock gives, and he slides the crowbar back into his belt in exchange for his PKA. This, finally, drives away some of the voices: the way it kicks back in his arms as he fires, the way the spiders’ blue blood hangs weightless in the air and casts oceanic fractals across the metal floor in the light of his headlamp. He turns his head as his fellow salvager touches down on the wreck, magboots engaging and sending a faint tremor through the hullplates they stand on. 
<br><br>
"My jetpack ran out," Everett says, and Bets frowns. It's unlike them, forgetting something so simple, but he chalks it up to a racing mind. He shrugs off that gnawing doubt, pressing further into the ship's corpse. He clicks his tongue. Very little of value. Just scrap metal. In and out. He returns to the entrance, and sees them staring at the small globes of blue suspended in the vacuum. 
<br><br>
"Cryoxadone." Their voice hums familiar through the headset, holding all the reverence and fascination with all things chemical that he has come to associate with them. "Bit of a waste." He chuckles. 
<br><br>
"Aye. Botany would have a field day."
<br><br>
And that's that. Until they touch down on the ship, and another salvage suit emerges from the airlock, and speaks in the same voice, and Bets's stomach drops.
<br><br>
“Who the <em>fuck</em> is that?” The fear in their voice is a knife that drags against his long-dead nerves. 
<br><br>
<em>They aren’t afraid of you. It’s not you. It’s</em> them.
<br><br>
But they—one of them, one of the two with the face and voice of the only person he has ever called family—are about to be. Because he has to make a choice. He is the one who has to decide which of the two is <em>his</em>, and which one wants to cut the other open and make a home in the skin that they leave behind. And then…
<br><br>
And then he has to kill the Other.
<br><br>
The PKA that felt so natural in his hands just minutes before hangs unimaginably heavy at his hip. He grits his teeth. He realizes that he may not be able to do it. So what <em>should</em> he do? Let the Other live, knowing what it wants, the risk it poses?
<br><br>
It has their face. Their movements. 
<br><br>
He glances between the two, hoping for any small fracture, any tell. But there is nothing. Even as one of them, the one who came out from the station, turns and runs. How many times has he seen them run scared? Not many, and too many all at once. Enough that he knows it is them, it is them, it is them. But then the one behind him speaks.
<br><br>
“I’m scared, Bets.”
<br><br>
And it cuts him to his core because it is THEM, it is THEM, it is THEM.
<br><br>
“Fuck,” he mutters under his breath.
<br><br>
The airlock hisses open once again, and he tenses, but it’s the quartermaster, Aoife, this time. The relief that he feels is laced with shame. Perhaps she can hold the gun, instead of him. But if he is the one consigning the thing that looks and sounds and moves and breathes like family to death, shouldn’t it be him? Doesn’t it have to be?
<br><br>
And he still doesn’t know. So he does what he does best: something fucking stupid.
<br><br>
“Ev,” he says, voice too loud in his helmet, knowing it’s too loud across the local comms that Aoife can hear. “Which department did I blow up today?”
<br><br>
Aoife stirs, but doesn’t move for a weapon. A good sign. Perhaps she is as shaken as he is. Perhaps the hole he blew in the side of the HoP’s office is a lesser issue. He can appreciate that. There was no life on the line, anyhow. Not like now. He told Everett, after it happened, because much as he would like to sometimes, he can’t keep secrets from them. And he needed them to know, needed to know that they weren’t giving up on him despite adding another drop to the sea of evils great and small that threaten to drown him. Selfish, selfish, selfish. And yet now, he is almost grateful for it, because the Everett now shying away from him cannot answer.
<br><br>
What it can do, however, is speak pure venom.
<br><br>
“You’re scaring me, Bets,” it says, and everything in him wants to throw aside his weapon and beg for their forgiveness. But he can’t. It’s not them.
<br><br>
“I know,” he says, and the words tear him apart.
<br><br>
“Are you going to hurt me?” Asks the same voice that has professed its trust in him, even as he asked them into back rooms with weapons drawn.
<br><br>
<em>But they all trusted you, didn’t they?</em>
<br><br>
Push it down, push it down. 
<br><br>
He stays silent, because he can’t promise that he won’t
<br><br>
This is not the first time he has looked into their eyes and seen fear (he doesn't remember, not in detail, just in borrowed flashes of memory cut short by stopped hearts and choked-up blood, nothing that truly belongs to him, but he *sees it*). Last time, it was tempered by pity, and he thought that that was the worst of it. But this time it is cut through with fury, like he is an open wound to be cauterized, and to speak is to light the torch.
<br><br>
And this, this is worse, but that righteous fire burns away the last of the doubt that he harbours, because it looks him in the eyes and says “Do you think I wanted this? That I’m some sort of clone?” and something inside him <em>breaks</em>.
<br><br>
The calm that washes over him will frighten him, in retrospect. He cocks his head, slowly, the angles of his family his friend his anchor twisted into dark, ugly shapes. A monstrous, starlit silhouette. 
<br><br>
“If you were really Everett,” he says, voice as cold as the void around them. “You would know better than to say <em>jack shit</em> to me about clones.” There is a moment, now, where the gun loses some of its weight, and he will ask himself for a long time whether it was because of the knowing, the fear, or the anger. But instead, he moves, past the not-Everett, past Aoife, and into the station itself. And Everett—his Everett, the one he would die for, kill for, who sees him as a person—is there, and says one word that nearly makes him weep:
<br><br>
<em>“Birds.”</em>
<br><br>
He lets out a shaky breath. Nods. Tells them he’ll be back, moves back out into the black. Can’t use comms, the Other has them, can’t know where the real thing is. Simply tells Aoife that he’s sure. And then he cannot look at it any longer, cannot stomach knowing that, be it by action or inaction, he has signed off on the death of the thing with a voice like home. 
<br><br>
It was so, so scared of him.
<br><br>
Later, on the evac shuttle, Everett says that they hope that their other self has gone home. To their Bets, to their Molly, to their Allen. Bets says he hopes so, too, because he can’t imagine a version of himself without them. But the knife in his gut twists ever so slightly when he does. Because it was scared of him. 
<br><br>
<em>When did they learn to hate you?</em>
