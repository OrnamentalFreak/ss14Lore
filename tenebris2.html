<p>
They're looking for the body. 
<br><br>
Bets is standing on the ATS, his heart pounding in his ears. He's not scared of capture (even as the strings draw tight around his wrists, they want him free and alive and he thinks it must be so that he can remember how it felt to pull the trigger, so that it keeps him HUNGRY). He's scared that, watching Everett's mess of dark curls disappear under their helmet, they are going to find it. They know, of course. Knew it would happen even before he came here the first time, bought the crate (a gamble for the gambler, is it really his fault that it died painfully if he was only working with the tools fortune afforded him?), came up with the plan. But knowing and seeing are two different things. 
<br><br>
Tye is here too, of course. The man is not exactly what Bets would consider a bastion of responsibility, but despite telling him over and over that he could never work medbay like Bets does, that Bets is a good person and he isn't, that he doesn't have the empathy, Bets knows he does care. Even if he doesn't believe that he does. 
<br><br>
Bets tries not to see him as a mirror, most of the time. Likes the guy too much to reduce him to something he can't stomach looking into. 
<br><br>
Ev is going to find it. They're going to tell Tye. And they're both going to hate him. 
<br><br>
Bets clenches shaking fists. Breathes in, breathes out. Lets the rush of oxygen ease his aching pulse, drown out the rush of sound that should not exist as he steps out into the pitch darkness. 
<br><br>
The radio crackles, the distance carving the tone out of the words that bleed into his ears, leaving only a sterile rasp. "Any sign of it?" 
<br><br>
He cannot answer, his throat dry. How can he speak the words that they are so soon going to contradict? It will not be a betrayal, he thinks. To ask for their silence would be to ask them to be complicit. He doesn't want to poison them any more than he already has. 
<br><br>
That damned guilt again. He's one to talk about poison, about letting something you love drag you down because you tell yourself that the high is worth the decay it brings with it. But it's alright, when he's doing it to himself. To do it to—
<br><br>
Everett's voice, so close as they both drift through space, does not suffer the same decay. If only it did, if only he could pretend it was someone else. "Last I heard," they say, "it was going on a mail run." 
<br><br>
Has the high ever been worth this?
<br><br>
They touch down on the solar grid. <em>"You don't have to lie for me,"</em> he whispers, hoping that the low-range frequency he has switched to won't reach the man inside the trade station. 
<br><br>
<em>"It's not a lie,"</em> they reply, just as quietly. <em>"Last I heard, they were going on a mail run. I don't know any more than that."</em>
<br><br>
He bites his tongue. He's gotten them in too deep now. It's all he can do to stop them from getting in any deeper. 
<br><br>
<em>"And that's all you're gonna know,"</em> he promises. They push off the scaffolding, back towards the light. 
<br><br>
Tye is gone, back to the station, bearing bad news for hopeful hearts. Something jolts through Bets, and he isn’t sure whether it is shame or pride or some sick, impossible mix of the two. Their helmets come off, and Everett looks him in the eyes with a kind of mournful determination. 
<br><br>
“You know if I find it, I’m gonna bring it back.” It is a statement, not a question.
<br><br>
He answers anyway. “I know. It’s what you do. I…admire that, actually. A lot. As fucked up as it is to say.” When he says “Y’know, on days that ain’t like this, I like to think I learned that from you,” what he thinks he means is that he learned from watching them (brave, reckless, kind), and to some degree it is true. But there is also a deep-seated knowledge that remembers that he learned just as much from the ashes on the floor and on his gloves back on Omega, learned what it felt like to fail, to lose someone. 
<br><br>
He has grown so used to *being* lost. Sometimes, looking down at corpses on cryobeds, he wonders what they feel every time they have to stand over his body. He hopes it doesn’t hurt too badly. But he knows enough, now, about what it’s like, to know that that hope is unfounded.
<br><br>
The expression Everett turns toward him is complicated. Pride and sorrow, impossible opposites drawn together.

<p>
He wants to be able to tell them it’s over. But it’s not. The crowd calls for an encore. The chorus rises again.
</p>
<p class="quote">

</p>
<p>
He is afraid of what he is going to have to do, and the drinks are not helping as much as he wanted them to. He sways as he speaks, words bleeding into each other.
<br><br>
“I’m goin’ to do somethin’ loud, and stupid,” he warns them. Sees them tense, watches as they fight the way that their mind tries to pull the shutters over their eyes before they can respond.
<br><br>
They look at him one last time before they let their defense mechanisms take control. Ask him to leave a note, the things he doesn’t want to forget. The song pulls so strongly at him now (time is running out, running fast on prey-legs). But they’re right. He doesn’t want to forget.
<br><br>
<em>”You’re still my person, Bets.”</em>
<br><br>
So he pins his ears back, grits his teeth. Retrieves pen and paper from the cargo desk, and pauses with his hand hovering over the blank sheet. He knows what he wants to remember, but finds himself asking what to write. Words are so goddamned heavy, and if what he thinks will happen happens…
<br><br>
They won’t be his to carry. How much can he put upon their shoulders, especially now?
<br><br>
He settles on something simple: <em>In the end, you are still you, and they are still them, and they still care.</em> It will be enough.
<br><br>
"I'll check your locker," they say at the same moment he tells them, "I'll leave it in your locker." This is how it always is, two halves of the same twisted shape, fundamentally different and yet so self evident in their belonging. 
<br><br>
(This is an echo, an echo of another life, one that not even the ghosts could whisper to them when they woke, for there were no ghosts left. His blood around the bullet holes in his suit, his blood on the palm they bring up to meet his against the too-thick glass of the firelock. They are bathed in nuclear sunset, and he sees it in their eyes: the fire, always fire, against the green bright enough that even he can make it out. "It's okay." He tells them. "It'll be okay," says the voice that mixes with his, a duet sung to memories lost to flame and ash.)
<br><br>
They leave the station. He hoists the gun, and goes to medbay.

There are too many people, and they are all so damned brave. Too brave.
<br><br>
“EVERYONE OUT,” he barks. Turns the PKA on the chemist, the gun he has watched tear holes in ship hulls levelled towards their skull. “Except them,” he continues. 
<br><br>
Nobody will leave. Why won’t they listen? He doesn’t want to — <strong>JUST KILL THEM ALL - THEY ARE ALL JUST MEAT JUST FLESH THEY DIE SO EASILY - THEY CAN’T HATE YOU IF THEY HAVE NO MIND TO REMEMBER THIS WITH</strong> — hurt them. He keens, turning and firing into the wall beside Molly’s head, and the way she screams sends hate/joy/revulsion/pride through him. She is begging him, Aoife is standing over a patient, Attacus is shouting when he is so used to a quiet anger. He did this, he did this, he did this. 
<br><br>
“I SAID, EVERYONE OUT,” he bellows, and then Molly is there, beating her fists against his suit, and he does not know what to do because everyone else in this room could die but — <strong>WHY NOT HER - WHAT MAKES HER SO SPECIAL - WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU HAVE A FUCKING CHOICE - MEMORIES COME CHEAP</strong> — if he kills her, he does not think he will forgive himself.
<br><br>
She will tell him later that she’s sorry. For being flighty. He knows she thinks she is a coward, has had an inkling that it has something to do with what he did when he saved her, even if he doesn’t know the details. But she’s wrong. She was brave, back when they both stood over Everett’s suddenly too-small body in a black bag, and he couldn’t fucking breathe and she was the one who stitched their wounds shut, brought them back. She is brave now, trying and trying and trying to move him. And what fucking choice does he have but to let her?
<br><br>
It is all shame, now, both from within and from without as he backs away. Leaves. Because, after all that, he cannot turn the gun on her.
<br><br>
Why are all of the people he cares about so much braver than he deserves?
</p>

<p>
The rest of the shift passes in a kind of limbo. He is numb, and part of him wishes someone would just fucking shoot him so that he can stop thinking about the looks in their eyes. But no one will. Even Tye, voice full of disappointment, won’t cuff him won’t demote him won’t do anything but beg him to <em>stop</em>. 
<br><br>
So he stops. Trawls through wreckage he barely sees, with a best friend he barely speaks to because what does he have the right to say? And then evac docks, and he sees the chemist, and sound comes crashing back.
<br><br>
“Ev?” he asks over the cargo frequency. “You got that note?”
<br><br>
There is a hesitance in their voice. They know what’s coming. But they do not lie. “Yes.”
<br><br>
“Good.” And he draws the knife, and there is screaming, and the sound of a locker door slamming shut that he does not hear, does not see, does not realize is his family with their eyes screwed shut and their hands over their ears, which is not enough to block out the sound of the gun.
<br><br>
He doesn’t succeed, in the end. But as he mutters to himself, laughter bubbling up through his chest, the song finds some small modicum of harmony. “I tried,” he stutters out, his blood running thick onto the ground. “They have to bring me back, now. Right? I tried, I tried, I tried…”
<br><br>
Lotash looks at him like something else is wearing his skin, something that he does not recognize. 
</p>

<p>
Bets pulls the chemist’s jacket tighter around himself, frowning down at the plants in the hydro beds. Uncooperative little shites. Footsteps click towards him across the tile, and he looks up to see Everett in their voidsuit. He smiles, somewhat nervously, and hurries out into the hall to meet them.
<br><br>
“Did you, um…” They fidget. “...want the note back?”
<br><br>
He blinks. Memories of the last shift are sparse, but this dredges something up out of the ocean of his mind.
<br><br>
The note.
<br><br>
He tugs at the hem of the jacket, not sure how much more he wants to remember. It’s never good. “I mean…I don’t need it, really. They didn’t… I lived.”
<br><br>
But they are insistent, and as stubborn as he is, he has never been able to out-stubborn them. He acquiesces, and they push the folded sheet into his hand with a kind of urgency. He notices the way it is bent at the bottom, as if gripped a little too tightly, in panic or sorrow or something in between.
<br><br>
He waits until they are gone to unfold it. To read it. To remember. It all comes back to him, and he grits his teeth through the worst of it, an animal response to the only kind of pain he can still feel. But it is worth it, in the end.
<br><br>
Because he remembers.
<br><br>
He is still him.<br>
They are still them.<br>
And they still care.
<br><br>
He folds it up and tucks it in the pocket of his jacket closest to his heart.
