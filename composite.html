The praetorian rounds the corner. Bets lifts the PKA, muscle memory taking over and thank fuck for that, because his vision goes white and all he can see is
<br><br>
<em>teeth against the glass, old wounds aching, fear rooted so deep in their psyche it paints the corners of their vision white</em>
<br><br>
and then it is dead, bleeding yellow-green across the tiles. Fishes nods at him, and he returns the gesture, trying to tamp down the crawling guilt that threatens to push its way through his chest like—
<br><br>
—no. That is not his. 
<br><br>
“I’ve never seen xenos before,” Fishes says.

His legs. Why can’t he feel his legs? He tries to sit, tries to look, but his body will not answer him, and his hands slide out from under him, unable to find purchase against the…
<br><br>
The blood. Oh god, the blood, oh god is it his?
<br><br>
He looks up. He looks, and he sees himself. There is blood around his mouth, painting his engineering suit, and a madness in his eyes. Joy and fear and* hunger*. He knows how the meat tasted because Tye has tasted it, too. He has no memory of it to call his own. None of this is his, because in the end he—
<br><br>
Died. But this is not his final rest, this is watching his best friend looking down at him, bloodied and burnt on a cryobed and begging for him to wake up. And then he does, and his hand wraps around their arm and he says something, something that the observer cannot hear, and Everett goes pale before something crosses their face, something that washes away the fear or the hurt or the guilt. Tabula rasa.
<br><br>
And now, now he is staring at himself down the barrel of a gun, and despite that, he finds himself consumed by a devotion that he does not deserve, does not understand. That survives, that sings, promising that even if he pulls the trigger it will remain. And that's the worst part of it. He doesn't want to know that they'd forgive him for it. He doesn't want that leeway.
<br><br>
He is watching himself as he falls, mouths a silent thanks for a death that he believes he deserves, because he did rob him of his family, didn’t he?
</p>
<p>
When compared to this, the alternative is preferable. He does not want to watch himself bring about endings. It is far easier to watch his own.
</p>
<p class="flashback">
A disabler is pressed into his hands, hands that have never before held a gun but know the shape by memory. He sees through eyes that watch him walk through the doors knowing that he won’t come back, but hoping that he might buy time, because time is more precious than a life. Red suits, red blood, red fire tearing through the station as seen from the void of space.
<br><br>
The baton snaps his head to the side, and his body goes rigid as energy courses through it. Cuffs are drawn around his wrists, and the first bomb tears him apart, but not enough. They can bring him back. The second bomb reduces him to a spray of scarlet, and he is gone.
<br><br>
Nitrogen hisses through his mask, and he sighs. “DNR,” he announces in another’s voice. He sees the way that Everett flinches. He does not care. There are too many dead at his hand to feel pity for their killer.
<br><br>
He has a plasma canister. No. No, he wouldn’t, no he’s—
<br><br>
—he’s opening it, he is turning his welder on, and he is going up in flames. He is smiling.
<br><br>
He is turning, reaching towards Everett, in the distance. Their bodies are so small, so far away. It spares him the details when the rod rips through them.
<br><br>
He is inside of a locker, he is sobbing, and he does not see it but he HEARS it. Hears the breaking and the tearing and the awful, awful silence. The dragons claw their way out of the evac shuttle, and he is alone, sole survivor.
<br><br>
He doesn’t want to believe that the fallen infected is him, but as the voidsuit comes into focus, he knows. Knows just in time to see the knife drawn across his throat, just in time to see his body go terribly, finally still.
<br><br>
He hears himself apologize over comms. “I’m sorry, Ev.” And then quiet.

“Me neither,” Bets says, and it’s not technically a lie. He hasn’t seen them.
<br><br>
But Everett has. And every time they bring him back, they have to rebuild them, each and every one of them. And every time they do, all those stolen parts of them that make up the whole of him rise closer to the surface.
<br><br>
It feels like a violation. But he cannot stop it, cannot shut his eyes, for horrors that are not his dance across the backs of his eyelids regardless.
<br><br>
None of this is his. But it is all of him.
