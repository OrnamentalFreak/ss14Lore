Bets rifles through his bag as he walks toward the evac docks, sighing. He had assumed he would have time to grab a pack of smokes on his way to drop off a fully researched artifact at cargo, but after the AME blew and knocked out the grid, his hopes of a fix had been dashed. But the motion remains, habitual, fingers twitching slightly as the withdrawal stains the corners of his vision muddy. Of all his vices, this one is probably the worst, he thinks. 
<br><br>
Needing something else to do with the compulsive movements, he reaches up to pick at the blood drying on his face. That damned arti spat out carp, of all things, and while he had managed to fight the things off with a crowbar, he’d taken his share of hits in return. His head is getting a little bit foggy by the time he reaches the docks, which perhaps explains why he does not register the way that one of the unfamiliar faces looks at him: frustration, as if at an interruption, which morphs into a look he <em>should</em> know well. 
<br><br>
Eyes sharpening, a quick intake of breath. Recognition of opportunity.
<br><br>
While he does not notice this, he does realize that, of the two figures, this one is familiar to him. The salvager is new, but the botanist is one he has seen on rare occasion. Ace, he thinks. Remembers him because he doesn’t speak, which at one point drove Bets to his wits’ end, but he’s learning.
<br><br>
<em>"Words are hard, sometimes."</em>" While their situations differ—he does not believe that Ace can talk, knows that Everett only struggles occasionally—understanding one has benefited the other. The man approaches him silently, offering up an expression Bets is well acquainted with, one which asks why he let himself fall into such a state. He grins, mouth drawn crooked by the scar tissue that warps his cheek. He reaches up to scratch at it idly. Ace begins to pull him away, and a glance at the clock tells him it’s a bit late to go to the medbay, but maybe he’s in worse shape than he thinks. He shrugs, letting himself be led down the hall and around a corner and—
<br><br>
—a sharp, pneumatic <em>hiss</em>. He raises an eyebrow. Has barely enough time to register that the object in the other man’s hand is not a medipen, but something small and grey and moving back towards him quickly. He opens his mouth, but cannot speak. Memories flash through his mind, the prick of a needle, an awakening within the fire. But engineering is gone. There is no burn chamber here. It is with a sickening sense of calm that he falls asleep.
<br><br>
He should have expected it, really. But somewhere along the line, he got too used to kindness.

<p>
He wakes up cuffed in a chair. Clears his throat, and is pleased to hear that sound escapes it. His radio is gone, but he can hear the announcement go out from the speakers in the hallway beyond the dim maintenance tunnel coming into focus around him: The shuttle has left. They are alone here. He sighs. No sense staying quiet, then. There’s nobody left to hear him.
<br><br>
(This is what he thinks. He doesn’t know about the one who realized he had been left behind, who stepped off the shuttle moments before the doors closed, who is here and searching despite knowing that he is not alone, that he may not be alive, that whoever was responsible is likely still on-station.)
<br><br>
“The glue was clever,” he says, somewhat hoarsely, breaking the silence. He receives a self-satisfied grin in response. He fidgets slightly, still craving that cigarette, rubbing his cheek against his shoulder to quell the phantom itch that fills the gap in his mind left by dead nerves. He grumbles to himself. It’s not working.
<br><br>
He thinks, a little, about trying to escape. His bonds are not strong. He has tools, maybe enough to deal substantial damage. A hardsuit. He’s good at playing the cooperative captive. But he is still badly wounded. Needs to be clever. Needs information. 
<br><br>
“Maroon, then?” He asks, flicking the ear his radio would normally be curled into. The ship is gone, and he is alive, a somewhat pleasant surprise. Ace chuckles quietly and shakes his head. Bets slumps back in the chair, staring toward the ceiling. He doesn’t think he is a proper target, unless Syndicate encryption has gotten <em>much</em> better, which he doubts. Lazy fuckers don’t seem to mind that their comms get intercepted every damn time they wake the sleepers up. Easier to invest in more bodies than better tech. He got here late, and didn’t hear any buzz on the radio.
<br><br>
His damn cheek still itches.
<br><br>
He pushes experimentally against his restraints, and Ace lets him get damn close to breaking them before his hands dart out, and he leans in close enough that Bets can see the scar that stretches vertically up his neck even in the dim light. A glance towards the hand encircling his wrist reveals another wrapped around his forearm, exposed by the rapid movement. Bets looks back up at him, sticking his tongue out. “Worth a try,” he says. Then, honestly, “My cheek itches.”
<br><br>
<em>"W-which one?"</em>" Bets’s eyebrows dart upward. So he <em>can</em> talk. Useful. Maybe he can bullshit his way into some answers.
<br><br>
“Take a wild fuckin’ guess,” Bets replies wryly. The hands leave his wrists, and Ace laughs at him, reaching up to scratch at both of his cheeks like he is some sort of animal. Bets would find it demeaning, but it is enough to quell the nagging in his mind, so he lets it slide. He also makes a pivotal mistake: As his captor laughs, he looks up at him, and backlit by the flickering, blue emergency light on the wall behind him, there is something in the way that his dark hair stands up at odd angles and his eyes turn up as he smiles that reminds Bets of—
<br><br>
He realizes that, even if he were to escape, he could not kill him.
<br><br>
He has gotten too soft for that.
<br><br>
“So…” He looks away. “What’s the plan, then? You need me dead?”
<br><br>
<em>"I-I was…s-supposed to d-die."</em> Understanding washes over Bets, and he grimaces. It <em>would</em> be here. Amber Station has had its heart torn out, and the hush around them is so different from the noise it was filled with when he…
<br><br>
“Ah,” he replies. “Well. That could be arranged.” It's a bad lie, and Bets knows it, knows that the falsehood is painted onto his face. It falls on deaf ears, though. 
<br><br>
Ace straightens, starts to pull him out of the chair. <em>"Need to d-do something, at l-least,"</em> he says. <em>Sh-show them I’m capab-ble. Prove a p-p-point."</em> Bets’s expression softens. He understands. Has been in his place too many times.
<br><br>
At least <em>he</em> will be the message. Not one of the others. Better it happens to someone who deserves it.
<br><br>
They move towards medical, out through the halls. Bets tries to talk to him, tries to wheedle anything else out of the once again silent man dragging him along in his shadow. Nothing. But then, a voice, echoing through the station’s silent metal husk:
<br><br>
“Bets?”
<br><br>
<em>Tye.</em>
<br><br>
Bets clamps his jaw shut, and Ace moves quickly, the hypo once again breaching scale and skin. Not that Bets needs chemical encouragement to remain silent. He utters a silent apology to Tye for not calling out, but he doesn’t <em>want</em> him to find him, doesn’t want him getting hurt. Back into maintenance, through the dark, until Ace pries open the door to medical. The sterile, chemical smell is almost comforting. Less so the closer they get to surgery.
<br><br>
The door creaks open, revealing a room in disrepair. Chemical advancements have rendered it vestigial, little more than a hiding place. Bets does not think that it will be a hiding place today.
<br><br>
More hissing, and Bets’s eyes roll back as he slumps forward. He awakens on the surgical bed, and watches Ace lift the red-striped canister. He twitches a little. He cannot feel pain. That doesn’t scare him. None of the tools, gleaming silver on their tray, are the source of the fear that sparks through his system. 
<br><br>
It’s the not knowing. The forgetting. 
<br><br>
“I can’t feel anything, anyways,” he croaks out. “So there’s no point. And I’d rather…” He swallows, a little too hard. “I’d rather know.”
<br><br>
Ace fixes the mask over Bets’s face, and he is still too sluggish to snap at his hands. <em>"Unf-fortunate,"</em> they say, almost gloating.
<br><br>
Bets sighs out, “It always is,” before the room goes blurry.
</p>

<p>
He is in and out of sleep. Can’t feel the pain, but does feel the strange sensation that is air brushing up against parts of him never meant to meet it. Watches red-dyed hands pull away from his throat, clutching strings of meat. Smells burning flesh, eliciting a whimper that—makes no sound, why does it make no…
<br><br>
And then the hands, the tools, the movement are gone. The effects of the nitrous oxide start to wane, and he realizes that his wrists are unbound. Panic fights against the artificial sleep still clinging to his limbs, and he paws the mask away from his mouth, gasping for air in the thinning atmosphere.
<br><br>
<em>Fuck.</em> He tries to speak, but all his mouth will produce is a wheeze. He stiffens, reaches towards his neck. Encounters half-dried blood and small, precise stitches. Remembers words whispered into his ear as the hands left his throat.
<br><br>
<em>"Now you’re like me."</em>
<br><br>
Shit, shit, SHIT—
<br><br>
He stumbles out into medbay proper, his feet carrying him towards where the chem locker usually sits. But then he remembers: Evac is gone. The chems are gone.
<br><br>
They’re all gone, and it’s just him, and—
<br><br>
“Bets?” Tye is standing, wide-eyed, in the doorway leading to the hall. Bets looks down at himself. Blood paints his hardsuit, and stains the hand he raises to wave shakily.
<br><br>
“Bets, what the fuck?” Bets opens and closes his mouth, then shakes his head. He isn’t sure whether or not he wants Tye to know, more than he just wants to be glad that he isn’t <em>alone</em>. He doesn’t want to burden the person who came looking for him with the knowledge of what happened.
<br><br>
But part of him needs someone else to carry it, at least until they can go home, to light and atmosphere and something to fucking drink. So he leads Tye into surgery, and the other man is confused, but brightens momentarily when he sees the nitrous. It’s so typical of him, and Bets wants to laugh. But he can’t. Tye turns to him, holding it out as an offer, and he shakes his head, reaching out to tap a claw against the pressure gauge, which sits low. Tye follows the movement, follows it as his hand moves up to the wound stretching vertically up his throat.
<br><br>
Tye goes white.
<br><br>
“Oh god. <em>Bets.</em>” He says.
<br><br>
Bets cannot answer.
