Light. 
<br><br>
There is light cascading across a blue sky. There is red soil under white boots, stale air circulating through an archaic helmet. There are plants he has never seen before, both alien-strange and somehow familiar. And then it comes back to wind, and sky, and blue, and—
<br><br>
"Birds..."
<br><br>
The doctor looks at him a little crookedly as he croaks the word out, cloning pod slurry still slick on his tongue and drying flaky on his lips. His chest aches, not from the convulsions they induce to force the fluid out of one's lungs, but from something...else. 
<br><br>
(Flashes of red, a face that trusts him so damn much (who, who), the feeling of bones breaking of meat under his hands in his mouth the shock of a defibrillator<em> "you shouldn't have brought me back"</em> Bets I CAN'TBREATHEyou'llbeokaywe'll)
<br><br>
And it's gone. Bets groans, pushing up onto his elbows. He can't feel the stiffness in his joints, but the exhaustion is there. The slight tinge of delirium. He's imagining things. It's happened before, hasn't it?

(It's like my mind is a deck of cards, and someone's shuffled it)
<br><br>
So they brought him back. After all that, they brought him back. 
<br><br>
He tries not to think about it. About what that entails. 
<br><br>
They tell him there's someone new. A fresh face, eager to learn. When he sees her the next day, she looks so hopeful. He allows himself to be a little hopeful, too. And something stirs inside of him. Some kind of catching kindness. He looks around at his people. Brooke, Violet, Cori. There is a passing, fleeting guilt that begs him to chase it as it runs, but he digs in his heels. He has a job to do, and escapism has always been his forte. But he grants it this:
<br><br>
He will protect them. That much he can promise.
