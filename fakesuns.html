   <p>
Bets wakes, not to the sound of birds (he has learned to sleep through it, as of late), but to a knock at the door. He tenses momentarily. No one comes here. This place, much as he hates it, is <em>his</em>. The only ones who know about it are him, NT, and his makers, and they have not trespassed yet. And he's been <em>listening</em>. 
<br><br>
Another knock. He hisses, and slides out of bed, hurriedly pulling on a long-sleeved sweatshirt that hides most of the burns that pull the flesh of his arms in strange directions. Pushes out of the bedroom, past the couch, and growls as a third, more impatient knock sounds through the small unit. He reaches forward, and opens the door. 
<br><br>
He is met, at eye-level, with a scarred throat. He blinks, and the pieces snap into place. He groans. 
<br><br>
<em>"It's you,"</em> he grumbles. A nod in return. He rolls his eyes as Ace looks down at him and smirks, reaching up to poke the tag sticking out the <em>front</em> of his shirt.  <em>"You're early."</em>
<br><br>
Ace raises an eyebrow. Glances left and right down the hall, appraising it, making sure it's truly empty. <em>"It's...n-nearly noon."</em> 
<br><br>
<em>"Point remains,"</em> Bets growls, but lets him in nonetheless. 
<br><br>
Ace casts an appraising gaze around the apartment as Bets wrestles with his shirt, turning it the right way ‘round before flicking his ear in slight discomfort. He should have remembered he was coming, but in truth, time spent outside of shifts has never really <em>clicked</em> for him. He loses track, and it shows in the way the space feels a little too lived-in. Empty bottles sit on the table in the small living room, and he can see the dishes stacked in the kitchen sink out of the corner of his eye. He glances somewhat nervously at his guest, but Ace’s face remains passive, and he points to the couch with a raised eyebrow, hefting his bag with the other hand. Bets nods, and he ambles over to it, setting it down to one side. He then turns, and Bets follows his gaze toward the sliding doors that lead out to the balcony and, more importantly, the garden.
<br><br>
Bets holds up a finger, frowning as he pats his pockets and finds them empty. He ducks back into his room, and fumbles beneath the windowsill, next to the switch that mutes the morning birdsong that no longer wakes him. Attached a few inches to its left with a thin strip of adhesive, his hand encounters a small cardboard box. He deftly flips the top open and retrieves two long, thin cigarettes before closing it again. Maybe he’s paranoid, but he doesn’t want to risk any prying eyes catching a glimpse of the red and black pattern across the carton’s surface. He ambles back out, still somewhat bleary, and nudges his way past Ace and out onto the balcony. He tucks the smoke between his lips, lights it, and holds the second one out towards the other man, who steps outside (as much as one can call it that) behind him.
<br><br>
Ace frowns slightly, cocking his head. Doesn’t usually smoke, unless it’s—
<br><br>
<em>“The good shit,”</em> Bets hisses out around a mouthful of medicated smoke. <em>“Bought some off the docs at the Pit. For…”</em> He tilts his head back and forth. <em>“Emergencies.”</em>
<br><br>
Ace smirks, taking the cigarette and motioning for the lighter. After a deep inhale that sees his shoulders relax, just slightly, he whispers out, <em>“Oh, so th-that’s what I a-am? An em-mergency?”</em> Bets snorts.
<br><br>
<em>“I was sleeping.”</em>
<br><br>
Rolled eyes, and a hoarse laugh. Ace’s face stills a little, and he leans over the guardrail, looking down. His brow furrows, slightly, as he takes in the uncanny valley effect of the screens.
<br><br>
<em>“Ugly, huh?”</em> Bets murmurs, frowning up at the fake sky.
<br><br>
Ace stares into a sun that radiates no heat. <em>“S-something, at least. N-nice to have…something.”</em> Bets clicks his tongue, and shrugs. Not dismissive, but not wanting to pry into something that is not being offered.
<br><br>
<em>“I…”</em> He sighs. <em>“I guess.”</em> Ace pulls away from the railing, shaking his head slightly as if it has thrown him somewhat off-balance, and turns towards the one thing in the damned box that is real: The garden.
<br><br>
Plants spill radiant colour down the far wall, and Ace seems almost magnetically pulled towards them. He sets the half-finished smoke down in the too-full ashtray, ember slowly crawling down its length, not wanting the ashes to fall on the fragile life that sways gently in the not-breeze. He crouches in front of the plants lowest to the ground. Bets eyes his own cigarette, and then the door back inside. His mouth twitches into a momentary half-grin, and he sets it down beside Ace’s, disappearing for a moment before returning with the watering can.
<br><br>
Ace is leaning over a small carrot plant, gently turning a fallen leaf over in his hands. He frowns up at Bets, and pointedly presses his finger into the too-dry soil. He then does the same to the poppy plant nearby, and it comes up muddy. He raises a somewhat accusatory eyebrow, and Bets grumbles quietly, holding out the watering can.
<br><br>
<em>“Yeah, yeah,”</em> he mutters. <em>“Not my fault, can’t eat the damn things.”</em>
<br><br>
<em>“You’re…eating th-the poppies, th-then?”</em> Ace jabs, taking the watering can from him.
<br><br>
<em>“Shut up,”</em> Bets snaps, snatching his cigarette back from the ashtray and tapping it on its edge before returning it to his mouth. His glower relaxes as he watches Ace move between the plants, an expression on his face that seems almost wistful. Bets smiles, slightly, fondly. There’s something about seeing him in his element, when that element is not violence, that is a window into how the people around them see the other man. A reminder of the pieces other people have of him, drawing stark contrast to the pieces that, for now, belong to Bets alone.
<br><br>
Ace steps back, free hand on his hip, and nods to himself. Satisfied, a job well done. Bets reaches forward and lifts the watering can from his hand. <em>“Take anythin’ you want,”</em> he says. <em>“Got more’n I need, and I can’t even eat most of it.”</em> He chuckles.
<br><br>
Ace nods, cocking his head. <em>“Y-you don’t…cook.”</em> Bets narrows his eyes, but nods, scratching his cheek. Ace steps back into the greenery, and Bets catches <em>something</em> about “dinner” and “damn dishes,” which he takes as a hint, leaving Ace alone with the plants. He sets the watering can down on the counter, turns toward the sink, and sighs. He rolls up his sleeves, and gets to work.

<p>
They leave the apartment complex and emerge into the swell of motion that is the street outside. While Ace had clearly been expecting Bets’s fridge to be…somewhat lacking, it was very quickly abundantly clear that it had exceeded his expectations. While they could have simply ordered groceries via one of the brightly-branded, corporate terminals embedded into the walls of the unit, Bets had needed the change of scenery. So, here they were. Ace shuffles somewhat uncomfortably. His pale eyes dart around, taking in their surroundings, but quickly darting to the ground as soon as anyone gets too close. Bets sighs, dropping his tail, which he had tucked up through the crook of his arm. It takes up too much space, and people shoot him some dirty looks, but it creates a buffer. And nobody is going to argue with the angry-looking, burn-scarred lizard.
<br><br>
It is very rare that he is truly grateful for the scars, in places like this. He hates the looks that they draw, especially outside of the station. When he’s working, everyone has scars, even if not many have them in the quantities that he does. Here, he is an outlier.
<br><br>
They’re both outliers.
<br><br>
Ace stares up at the fake sky, shielding his eyes with a hand. The light is carefully tailored, not enough to do any real damage, but enough to sting a little. Today, a bright yellow sun hangs above a smaller, blue-violet one to the west. Bets looks up as well, but the sky shifts in his vision, and he rubs his temples slightly. Ace stands very, very still, and as Bets’s eyesight comes back into focus, he chances a look at his expression. Ace looks conflicted, mouth turned down in a slight frown. Like he’s looking at the face of someone he hasn’t seen since both were children, still familiar, but changed. 
<br><br>
Bets reaches up, tugging on the sleeve of his black t-shirt. He startles, as if pulled back from reverie, and looks down.
<br><br>
<em>“You’re gettin’ stuck,”</em> Bets says. Ace rubs the back of his neck, corners of his mouth twisting downward, then shakes his head slightly. The two move forward, Bets leading him towards a small building crouched unassumingly on the corner a couple blocks away.
<br><br>
The inside is clinical, screens displaying slightly grime-obscured images of food and drink. Bets gestures forward, broadly. <em>“You’re the cook,”</em> he rumbles. <em>“I dunno what the fuck I’m lookin’ for.”</em> Ace rolls his eyes, then scowls slightly at the price readouts on a nearby display. Bets laughs. <em>“Don’t stress it. I’ve been on a winnin’ streak.”</em> 
<br><br>
Ace nods thoughtfully, then grins. He holds up his hand, tapping a bare ring finger. Bets glances down at the gold band around his own, and huffs. <em>“That’s what I get for bein’ generous,”</em> he mutters, but his scowl slips too easily into a returned grin. 
<br><br>
Orders placed and slated to arrive at his apartment later that day, the two leave. Bets glances back in the direction of his home, then shakes his head slightly. <em>“Need a drink.”</em> Ace looks at him somewhat disapprovingly, tapping an invisible watch. The message is clear: <em>This early?</em> Bets swats his hand down.
<br><br>
<em>“Not that kinda drink, fucker,”</em> he retorts. <em>“Follow me.”</em> Ace grumbles, but trails behind him regardless.
<br><br>
He does perk up, however, when they enter the small cafe. The small, local atmosphere is manufactured—everything here is—but it’s still effective. The smell of freshly-ground coffee permeates the air, and jars of dried tea leaves line the decorative shelves spaced around the seating area. <em>“Latte?”</em> Bets asks, and Ace nods, pulling out a slip of paper and jotting down a few extra specifications: more creamer, more sugar. Bets smirks as he reads it over, committing it to memory, and hands it back before walking to the counter, ordering for both of them.
<br><br>
A clawed hand enters Ace’s field of vision as stares out the window on the other side of the table, and sets a steaming mug in front of him. He smiles as Bets settles down with his back to the plate glass, cupping his hands around the mug. Ace squints slightly at him, carefully laying his palm against the side of his own mug before snatching it back with a quiet hiss. Still too hot. He raises an eyebrow at Bets, tapping the table in front of the lizard, who blinks. Realization crosses his face, alongside a slightly chagrined smile, and he sets the scalding hot mug, which he cannot feel burning his hands, down.
<br><br>
Ace blows across the top of the steaming coffee in his cup, and Bets stares down at his green tea, as if he can will it to cool down if he just glares at it hard enough. 
</p>

<p>
The tram is empty as it hurtles through the dark. The artificial suns were starting to dip below the horizon when they left the residential dome, and from where they are now, none of the glow of life is visible anymore. Ace sits beside him, quietly reading, as Bets twists the ring on his finger. He is jolted out of his fidgeting by an elbow to the arm, and he looks over with a small frown.
<br><br>
<em>“What?”</em> he mumbles.
<br><br>
Ace closes his book and sets it in his lap. <em>“That anxious t-to get rid of i-it?”</em> He asks, looking amused.
<br><br>
<em>“Mm,”</em> Bets grunts. <em>“Well. One less thin’ to fidget with. But sacrifices gotta be made, I’m afraid.”</em> He grins crookedly. <em>“Ain’t lettin’ you win this one.”</em>
<br><br>
Ace laughs. <em>“You say that l-l-like you th-think it’ll be easy.”</em> He leans toward him, slight height advantage lending him an air that others might find intimidating. <em>“Y-you may have th-the home advantage. B-but I’ll at l-least put up a f-f-fight.”</em>
<br><br>
Bets’s eyes spark defiantly as he smiles up at him. <em>“You fuckin’ better,”</em> he replies. <em>“No blood, no show.”</em>
<br><br>
Ace settles back, nodding. He reopens his book. The smile does not leave his face.
</p>
<p class="quote">

</p>
<p>
The Pit is humid, smelling of copper and sweat. Bets stands in the ring, awash in the clamor around him. He has a reputation. They’re excited. There is going to be blood spilled, and they are hungry for it.
<br><br>
If only they knew. But they will. Soon.
<br><br>
The crowd ripples with motion as his opponent moves across the floor. The roar changes into a storm of murmurs, and Bets scans some of the faces closer to the Pit itself. He watches money change hands, quickly. He raises an eyebrow. Ace <em>should</em> be unfamiliar to them. But he’s not. As he walks towards the ring, his head tilts slightly to the side, and he flinches.
<br><br>
Bets’s eyes narrow, rolling across some of the more familiar figures. He perks up his ears, trying to sift through the maelstrom of language around them, and eventually latches on to one word:
<br><br>
<em>Spade.</em>
<br><br>
Spade. He catches it, follows it back to its source every time it surfaces. He starts to make mental notes: Who to follow, who to ask. But he stops himself. These questions are not his, and Ace needs to…<em>wants</em> to find the answers himself. He has to stop himself from reaching up to scratch his throat. His scars are on full display as he stands in the ring, clad in simple boxer’s shorts, and he can’t let the sharks see that they bother him.
<br><br>
The gate creaks open, and Ace enters the caged-in ring, hopping lithely over the ropes. He wears a loose, white tank top and dark shorts. As he stands opposite him, Bets watches him adjust his wrist wraps to better cover his scars, but there is nothing obscuring the fine white line on his throat. Those close enough to see glance between them, two scarred mirrors. And then, the crowd is gone. Bets shuts them out, and it is only him, it is only Ace, and it is only—
<br><br>
—the sound of the bell.
<br><br>
Normally, Bets would take his time. Size his opponent up. But this time, he knows the measure of him, knows because he has torn into him time and time again. And he has been waiting, wanting, <em>needing</em> this. They are always so separate: Separated by the gun, the crusher, the knife. But this is just <em>them</em>, and he is all claws and teeth and madness. Madness that he can see reflected in the flash of Ace’s eyes as he coils in on himself, precision lined up against brute force as they collide. Bets throws a wide feint toward Ace’s gut, knowing that Ace will read it as a lie, knowing that that’s fine with him because if it was over so quickly it would be a bitter disappointment. Ace grabs his arm, pulling him forward, but Bets wraps his tail around one of the ring’s supports to steady himself, and pulls back and and down. This is his territory, his turf, and he knows how to use it.
<br><br>
His skull crashes into Ace’s, reminiscent of a friendlier moment (<em>“Lizard hug”</em>), and Ace wrenches free, leaping back and away. A bruise has already started to bloom around one of his eyes, dark blue haloing the white. He grins, and darts forward, keeping low to the ground, and Bets braces to meet him. But these are movements he doesn’t know, and he is caught off guard when Ace suddenly digs in his heels and snaps upward, driving the heel of his hand into Bets’s mangled jaw. His head snaps to the side, and he feels his teeth meet his tongue, tastes blood. He whips back around, seeing red, letting the scarlet drip out of the gap in his lips. He surges forward, claws curled, brute force and raw fury propelling him. It is more than Ace’s defenses can account for in the small space, and red florets bloom across his white shirt. Bets begins to taste victory, begins to almost imagine that he can feel the ring chafing against his finger, before the bell sounds again. A break in the bout. Round one, no victor.
<br><br>
The two separate, moving back to their respective corners. Bets wipes the blood off of his face, leaving a dark, wet smear across the back of his hand. Across from him, Ace frowns down at his shirt (what remains of it), before shrugging it off. Red ribbons curl, weeping, across his torso, and Bets’s eyes skirt the damage he has wrought. He grins, and Ace looks up, meeting his gaze. Grins back.
<br><br>
The bell sounds again, but this time neither moves in immediately. Because there is something in the look on Ace’s face that gives Bets pause, not out of fear, but out of curiosity. It is a look that says that the pieces on the game board have lined up <em>the way he wants them to</em>, and Bets has never been one to flip the board just because the pieces are not in his favour. So he watches as Ace pulls a small, white paper packet out of his wrist wraps and shakes two small pills into his palm. Brings them to his mouth. Swallows.
<br><br>
The effect is not instantaneous, but Bets sees it as they hit. The pain seems to leave him, the tender wounds he had been favouring cast to the wayside as he moves. Fast, too fast, and his face is in front of Bets’s, and the violence in his eyes is a hum that flickers behind the pupil-less white. There is no pain, there never is, but there is a sickening <em>pop</em> as a foot meets his knee and it bends the wrong direction. Bets hits the mat hard, and hisses in frustration.
<br><br>
<em>“Cheatin’,”</em> he grunts, and Ace smirks down. Bets can read the reminder in his expression: <em>You did say it was allowed.</em> And he did. So he can’t be angry. He can only come back swinging. He contorts, sliding his good leg back under himself, and lurches to his feet, only to be met with a shoulder, dropped low, firing up into his stomach. He fights for breath, corners of his vision going dark, and then—
<br><br>
—he is clad in ERT blue, body slamming back against a wall. The figure before him is small, too small for such fierce strength. But he is losing, will lose, will die, and he knows it. The fear is icy cold, mixing with the almost burning heat of the blood that slips from the holes torn into his body.
<br><br>
—he is standing opposite a diminutive figure. A child. How did he get here, teaching such a small thing the ways of war? But it is angry, it is violent, its dark hair standing up in strange unruly tufts. It moves, cold and uncaring, its knife lying forgotten as its hands stretch out towards him, desperate for blood and breaking.
<br><br>
—and he is himself again, laid back on the ground, Ace’s hands around his throat.
<br><br>
He brings his legs up, ignoring the way one seems sluggish, unable to respond, and kicks, using his tail to propel his lower body upward. Ace is launched backwards, but catches himself against the ropes as Bets hops to his feet, reaching down to snap his kneecap back into place. He looks across the ring, and for a moment Ace is layered upon himself, his movements blooming and bleeding into one another, and Bets is nearly crushed under a wave of understanding that threatens to drown him.
<br><br>
He feels something shift under his skin as the memories break the surface in his mind. His stance sharpens, his form becoming more fluid. A snake coiled to strike, precision over brute force. The crowd sees it, too, and for a moment there is quiet. A hush. He has changed, and something in the air has changed with him.
<br><br>
And then the bell, the bell, the bell.
<br><br>
Bets cannot look at Ace as he leans against the turnbuckle in his corner. Isn’t sure that he wants to see the ghosts of him. Hasn’t he seen enough? And before he knows it, they are launched back into the fray, and Ace is slowing down but still moving. And Bets’s mind is still in cascade, telling him to give in, to learn, to fight fire with fire, to move. And move he does, but it feels…
<br><br>
What he feels, first and foremost, is hesitation. This isn't his, this stream of memory that guides his steps, the bobs and weaves and small, sharp, just-enough movements. But, more than anything, he wants to understand the man who stands opposite him in the ring, black-eyed and bloodied and, in this moment, tasting victory. He wants to see all the moving parts of the person who cut him open and found something worth standing next to, worth keeping in his orbit. He wants to know.
<br><br>
Violence is the language that they share, and just this once, he has the chance to speak the same dialect.
<br><br>
He leans in.
<br><br>
It is <em>wrong</em> at first. It doesn’t <em>fit</em>. These are the motions of someone taller, someone human, someone not him. He is off-balance, and the hits keep coming, but the crawling beneath his skin isn’t stopping, and he lets it pull his joints and his muscles, lets it move him, lets it become <em>his</em>. He lets it speak.
<br><br>
Ace’s eyebrows rise. He recognizes this, this not-quite mirror image. Because Bets is smaller, balances differently, uses claws and teeth and tail. But the movements sing and harmonize with his own, and even as the pain creeps back in and dulls the edges of his awareness, he is cognizant of the shift in his opponent, his enemy, his friend; this person that sometimes seems to know him better than he knows himself. Who uses these motions, motions that he knows bone-deep even if he can’t remember learning them, against him. He has never liked sharing, but this is different, because violence is the one thing that they have both freely given.
<br><br>
Slowly, Bets starts to bring the fight back.
<br><br>
He darts in, feet light, movement fluid. Drives a palm up beneath Ace’s ribcage, hears the crack and the gasp of pain. Sees the way that the other man’s face contorts as he staggers backwards, which tells him that the pills are wearing off. Ace sidesteps the jab that flies towards his throat, but misses the leg that hooks around the back of his own and pulls. And then his back is on the mat, and he is black and blue and red, and Bets is seated on his chest. Scarlet runs from Bets’s split lip and drips down onto Ace’s cheek, and Ace knows he’s lost, but smiles nonetheless.
<br><br>
He chucks his chin, and Bets reads the motion and leans in, his head blocking the crowd’s view of the other man’s mouth. He is so close, and when he speaks his words are fire, fire that Bets is for once in his brief, flame-wreathed life not afraid of.
<br><br>
<em>“Make it count.”</em>
<br><br>
And in one bloody swing, this motion all his own, Bets tears his claws across Ace’s throat. Ace gurgles beneath him, ever so briefly, and there is no hatred in his eyes even as the pain flashes behind them.
<br><br>
(A mirror, always a mirror, of a knife drawn across a throat in the dark.)
<br><br>
Bets rocks back onto his heels, and stands above the corpse of a friend, who died with a shit-eating grin on his face.
<br><br>
The crowd roars.

</p>
<p>
“You gonna stay the whole time?” 
<br><br>
Bets grunts dismissively, and the doctor sighs, planting a bloody glove on his shoulder and pushing him away from the cryobed.
<br><br>
“He’s almost back, but you need to get the fuck away so I can work.” Bets shoves his hands into the pockets of his shorts, grumbling, but steps back slightly. Ace lies on the bed, perfectly still, quiet in a way that Bets has not known him to be for quite some time. A stack of bills sits on the table beside the bed, smears of blood across their dull surfaces where Bets held them to count them out. Revival fee. Paid in full.
<br><br>
The doctor flits around the room. Ace is not her only patient. It was a bloody night, reflected in the payout Bets received. Bonus for a good show, he was told. He worries, somewhat, that part of that may have been the resurfacing of a face familiar to some. <em>Spade.</em> He shakes his head slightly. Ace knew, as much as he could, what he was getting into. Bets can’t protect him from <em>possibilities</em>. Only certainties.
<br><br>
His ear twitches as he thinks back to a salvager, seated across the table from him. A warning, unheeded. She wouldn’t listen, wouldn’t keep her hands off of what was his. Wanted a dignified death. He had put six rounds into her chest instead, watched her slump forward over the table like a discarded puppet. It felt good. Certainties, he can deal with, because he has done it before.
<br><br>
The doctor returns to the bedside, defibrillator in hand. It’s time. Bets startles for just a moment, and steps forward, eliciting a sharp glare. <em>“I know,”</em> he says, <em>“just…gotta do somethin’.”</em> He had almost forgotten, in the comedown from that memory-high haze. He slips the ring from his finger, and lifts Ace’s hand from where it lies at his side. It’s stiff, and Bets is sure that if he could feel it, it would be cold as ice. He slides the band onto a lifeless finger, and gently sets the hand back down. The doctor furrows her brow.
<br><br>
“Do I wanna know?” she asks.
<br><br>
Bets smiles, and shakes his head. <em>“Prolly not.”</em>
<br><br>
“Hmm.” She does not press further, simply barks out “CLEAR!” There is a buzz, and the slight smell of burnt flesh, and Ace gasps on the bed.
<br><br>
“If you won’t leave, you can move him.” Bets nods, sliding his arms underneath the slightly stirring form on the cryobed and hoisting him up, over, and onto a bed proper. He steps away, and lights a smoke as he waits.
<br><br>
When Ace wakes up, he looks first to Bets, and second to his hand. He sighs, then laughs.
</p>
<p class="quote">

</p>
<p>
When they get home, the artificial sky is dark, hung with three moons and stars in an array of atmosphere-painted colours. Ace favours his ribs, slightly, and Bets glances over at him as they stand in front of the doors. He thinks, for a moment, about offering him an arm going up the stairs, but knows that that would in all likelihood just earn him a smack upside the head, so he dismisses the notion quickly. Instead, he slows his steps, still walking ahead of him, but not letting the distance grow the way he could. Four flights up, they tread quietly down the hall, footsteps dulled by sound-insulating tile.
<br><br>
Bets pushes open the door, and startles slightly at an unfamiliar shape in the corner of his vision. He flicks on the light, somewhat clumsily, and groans to himself when he realizes that it’s just the groceries. The insulated box sits neatly in front of the small, covered flap in the wall that they were delivered through. Ace perks up when he sees them, though he flinches slightly at the motion as he moves to sort through them.
<br><br>
<em>“Lemme get em,”</em> Bets says. <em>“I know how to put shit away, at least.”</em> There is muttering beside him, but he ignores it. <em>“Y’know you don’t gotta cook if you’re not—hey!”</em> He is cut off as a foot connects with the back of his leg. Not hard, but enough to get the point across.
<br><br>
<em>“I w-wanna, s-still,”</em> Ace mumbles. <em>“A-and you haven’t e-eaten s-since…”</em> His brows furrow. <em>“Have you…At a-all?”</em> And then it’s Bets’s turn to grouse under his breath, something about tea and it’s fine and he wasn’t even hungry, and Ace sighs as loudly as he can manage to.
<br><br>
<em>“J-just…”</em> Ace looks towards the balcony again. <em>“Owe m-me a smoke, f-first.”</em> The corner of his mouth curls upward. Bets chuckles, despite himself.
<br><br>
<em>“Bedroom,”</em> he says. <em>“Under the windowsill.”</em> Ace nods, and shuffles away. Bets carries the box into the kitchen, squinting at labels as he stocks unfamiliar ingredients in the fridge and the cupboards. He tells himself to watch what Ace does with them, not to let them linger. Maybe do the dishes more often. The other man reappears in his peripheral vision, but does not go outside immediately. Instead, a hand reaches forward, white scar around its wrist, and plucks a small jar from his hands.
<br><br>
A cigarette is tucked behind Ace’s ear. A second is in his other hand, and he holds it out towards Bets. Bets smiles, and takes it. Together, they walk out to the balcony.
