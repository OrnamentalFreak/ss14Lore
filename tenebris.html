He watches the way the light in its eyes dies (dark holes in its face, dark wounds on its body, so fitting for one named after night). He brings his hand up to his face, giddiness pulsing through him. He feels the way the scar stretches under his fingertips as he smiles. 
<br><br>
<em>"It's not a grudge, even if it's gonna look like it. It's just a job."</em>
<br><br>
While he can't lie to them, he <em>can</em> lie to himself. But now that the blood is starting to go tacky on the floor, now that his hands are on the body, now that his heart scream-sings of debts paid...
<br><br>
They are so, so good at propping open the doors he already wants to walk through.

Violence always comes calling in the language of music.
<br><br>
It is harsh and discordant, but something in Bets is able to untangle the notes of it: the hum of the blood in his veins becomes melody, the thudding of his heart percussion, the hiss of air through his helmet the keening of badly-tuned strings. His fingers twitch, longing for keys beneath them, the chance to drown it out with something beautiful instead. But here, on the debris, there is nothing. Just him, and the knowledge that there is only one way to stop the cacophony, a solution whispered in the six notes that form the grating motif.
<br><br>
An interruption from behind him. The soft jolt of booted feet against metal. He turns, his own voice rising against the drone of the chorus, always clashing. “Ev?” he asks quietly, knowing that the headset curled into his ear will pick up the vibrations in his skull. The way that the new arrival stiffens slightly tells him that the way his voice shakes is enough for them to know that something is wrong. “You meant it, right? What you said? About…if I had to…do what I have to do?”
<br><br>
They nod, slowly. The drums, pulling him back, pulling him towards where he knows IT is. “You don’t usually…tell me first,” they say, finally, voice slightly distorted as it is transported across the vacuum.
<br><br>
“I know,” he says, moving through the wreckage, trying to keep his hands busy so that they cannot stray towards — <strong>GUN-KNIFE-JUST USE YOUR FISTS-NO WITNESSES-NO SECRETS SPILLED-WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR-WHY WON’T YOU LISTEN</strong> — his bag. The names curl around his brain in whispers, one sung sweetly in a way that makes his blood run cold. They tug at his puppet strings, and the lie he speaks is not a lie meant to deceive Everett. He couldn’t. But he can absolutely lie to himself.
<br><br>
He thinks back. To the scientist, the fool, the enemy. Activated the artifact what the FUCK were you thinking have you no mind no will no RIGHT to TAKE my FAMILY FROM ME it is ALWAYS FIRE—
<br><br>
“It's not a grudge, even if it's gonna look like one. When it happens. Because then you’ll feel complicit, an’ I don’t want that, an’ I don’t know if you’d forgive me for that. It’s just a job.”
<br><br>
And damn it, damn him, he believes the words as they leave his lips.

He watches the way it speaks to them. He waits. Just because Everett knows does not mean that he wants them to see him lure it away. He fights to keep his breathing under control as his lungs try to force the air up his throat, as saliva runs thick through his mouth. Like some kind of fucking animal.
<br><br>
<em>“That’s all you are,”</em> says the song, <em>“all you’ll ever be.”</em>
<br><br>
Finally, an opening. He approaches it, and it shrinks away. He isn’t sure whether it is guilt or fear that creates the force between them, pushed apart as two like polarities (it is guilt, isn’t it, aren’t you the SAME), but either will do. He relishes it, wants to see what he can spark in its eyes when he pulls out the gun. But not here.
<br><br>
<em>“We should talk,”</em> he hisses quietly. There is a sharp tone, one that tells him to use Everett as an excuse (<em>“say it’s for them, say they wanted you to”</em>) but he can’t. Won’t. The anger rings through his ears like a misstruck cymbal, and he forces his expression to remain neutral. 
<br><br>
It agrees shockingly easily. Even suggests somewhere quiet. Fool, reckless little worm, this impulsivity is what got THEM KILLED. He tries to tamp down the voices, the chords that speak of anger. Just a job. Just a job. 
<br><br>
The ATS. It wants to go to the ATS. He almost laughs.
<br><br>
If he is unlucky, this will be painfully obvious. But he is so, so, so lucky, isn’t he? 
<br><br>
Sweet tones, harmonious notes.
<br><br>
“You understand what you did, don’t you?” He asks, tucked away into a backroom of the trade station, and the malice in his voice feels <em>right</em>. Nyx squirms.
<br><br>
“I do,” it replies. 
<br><br>
“They,” he continues, “are my fucking FAMILY.” He knows he should keep his voice down, knows that any of the others, any of his friends, could come through the bluespace locker at any moment. But he has been waiting, he has been so patient. He deserves this, to let the anger course through him, up from his guts and out of his mouth like a purged toxin. His hand slides into his bag almost by itself, wrapping around the grip of the gun.
<br><br>
The melody crescendos, all discordance forgotten, everything beautiful.
<br><br>
“Then you’ll understand—” he begins, and he is moving, he is firing, it is staring down at the hole punched in his chest (armor piercing rounds do horrible things to a body, but as the song swells all he sees is art). It crumples to the ground. He leans over it, face twisting into an expression somewhere between a smile and a choking gasp.
<br><br>
“—why this feels SO DAMN GOOD.”

He finds Everett, later. Staring at the blood. The song says—<strong>NO LOOSE ENDS-YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE GUN BUT YOU HAVE HANDS WRAP THEM AROUND THEIR THROAT-BITE DOWN THEIR BLOOD IS SO WARM JUST TASTE IT</strong>—that he should do anything BUT talk to them, but he can’t just leave them. It wouldn’t be right.
<br><br>
He fishes for anything to talk about but the pool on the floor. “No air,” he says finally, and they nod in the same detached way that they reserve for those beyond saving. 
<br><br>
“I ordered a can,” they reply, and he looks to see it sitting on the BUY platform.
<br><br>
“Ah.” He falters. Pushes through. “Usually takes eight or so to fill the place.”
<br><br>
Another nod. “I’ll ask Tye for more.”
<br><br>
“Right…” he says, and then he cannot keep up the facade. “Does it make it worse that I’m tryin’ to hold a normal conversation?”
<br><br>
“Probably a little,” they reply, and their laughter rings out clearly, louder than the music that has started to tip back into disarray. It is so madly out of place, and he knows that he should feel something other than relief. Knows that this is their way of protecting themselves. Not him. And yet…
<br><br>
“I…guess so.” He hates how brittle the laugh that escapes him sounds.
<br><br>
“You’re still my person, Bets.” His head whips around, and he feels the tension leave his body like a held breath. He finally smiles. Moves, pulls them into a hug.
<br><br>
The blood dries tacky on the floor.
