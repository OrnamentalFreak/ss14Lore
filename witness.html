    <p>Of course, it would be Amber.
<br><br>
Bets tries not to look at the surgical table, at the thing upon it, still alive but sedated. Dripping blood down onto the floor as Ace hovers over it, movements precise, but the aftermath messy. It’s not fear that drives his eyes <em?anywhere</em> else. Like Bets told him, earlier, when he returned from Atmos and handed him the nitrous oxide tank with a face that spoke discomfort: It isn’t fear when old scars start to itch. Just a reminder.
<br><br>
He doesn’t want Ace to think that he is afraid of this. It’s not a lie to say that he isn’t. He is not afraid of what <em>could be</em>. What he’s afraid of is:
<br><br>
What <em>could have been</em>. Forgetting, an absence, an emptiness where something now makes a home. Everything he has done, that they have made him do, has driven the others away. Everett doesn’t know, and he’s afraid of what they’ll think if they find out. Tye knows, but while he is many things, an anchor will never be one of them. Molly knows, she saw too much, and when the words “You’re still crew” left her lips, he knew that that was all he was, now. That there could be nothing and no one left to hold onto? That scares him.
<br><br>
He also, in some ways, fears what <em>is</em>. This thing that ties the two of them together. It is an insipid thing, a tether of sinew and tendon and the grief of what one has lost and one has never had (before, before, before). It is rotten to its core, but even decay smells sweet, does it not?
<br><br>
He isn’t scared that Ace could hurt him, because no violence that the other man could write upon his flesh will do more than leave a mark. The only way to hurt him now is to leave, and he knows that he won’t. Not after the bar, glasses strewn across the bartop and shattered on the floor, the station empty save for two men with matching scars. Not after the way that the knife carved neatly across one of them, a severing and a binding all at once, and Bets looked his butcher in the eyes because he could not flinch, could not feel it. 
<br><br>
(<em>“Sometimes…I w-wonder…if I was good, be-before…”</em> A quiet voice in a quiet salvage bay.
<br><br>
<em>“I dunno about goodness.”</em> An equally quiet reply. <em>“We’re all desperate, out here, and what defines you more than anythin’ is the moments when your hands shake.”</em>)
<br><br>
He knows Ace will not leave because he knows how his hands shook. It feels dangerously like caring, and by now, having felt that so many times, Bets knows why.
<br><br>
It’s because it is. 
<br><br>
<em>“T-told ya you wouldn’t like it.”</em> Ace’s voice crackles through Bets’s headset. He has not asked why the chemist has the engineering comms key, doesn’t really care. He had been thinking about offering it to him, until he stepped out to meet him in front of the intercom and met instead with an empty hallway. Bets huffs, just a little.
<br><br>
<em>“Yeah. Well,”</em> He says, not liking the conscious effort that he has to make to keep his tone neutral. <em>“I suppose at least this time I’m conscious for…”</em> He frowns. <em>“The seein’.”</em>
<br><br>
He sees Ace’s shoulders rise and fall out of his peripheral vision, as he stares straight ahead. <em>“Sup-ppose so,”</em> the taller man says. Smoke trails out of his mouth as he speaks, tricordrazine-laced cigarette clenched between his lips. Bets had offered him some the last time that they had worked together, knowing that speaking caused him pain. Apparently, they’re doing the trick, because Ace continues, <em>“Yours was c-cleaner.”</em>
<br><br>
Bets runs his thumb down the scar on his throat. <em>“I got that impression.”</em> He turns away as the thing on the table twitches and finally dies. <em>“Y’know. I don’t think it’s as bad for me as you think it is. It ain’t pretty, but…”</em> He trails off, unsure of how to continue. Because he knows better than to reveal a weakness, an uncertainty. But there’s also a part of him that wants to be here. Doesn’t want to be alone in yet another station full of ghosts. It seems like everywhere he walks becomes a graveyard, eventually.
<br><br>
<em>“G-g-guess a part of me… Hmmm…”</em> Bets flicks his ear as Ace stops, then mutters something that he can’t hear.
<br><br>
<em>“A part of you?”</em> No response. Bets leans back against the glass, and hears shuffling behind him. Less measured than it usually is. Agitated. He knows how this goes. Offer a little of yourself, let the smell of blood rise into the air, and the other is more likely to open a wound to match. <em>“Y’know,”</em> he starts, <em>“It ain’t the flesh part that makes me…”</em> He searches for a word, one that reveals enough, but doesn’t admit anything that Ace doesn’t already know. He settles on <em>“...uncomfortable.”</em> His ears twitch again, a habit he curses silently. <em>“Ain’t much you could do to the flesh that would.”</em> He hears footsteps approaching, and the light from the surgery room is partially blocked, a shadow falling onto the floor beside his own.
<br><br>
<em>“I think th-the r-reason…”</em> Ace’s voice is muffled by the pane of glass between them, but Bets’s ears swivel to pick up the notes. <em>“I w-warned you…tastes too m-m-much like caring, for my taste. I guess.”</em>
<br><br>
A small laugh escapes him, despite his best intentions. How long ago was it, now, that he was on the other end of this conversation? Caring, for the first time, and terrified. How long ago was it that the words <em>“I care, and it’s fuckin’ terrifyin’. Because there’s so much of it, and when somethin’ happens, it has nowhere to go”</em> filled the maints bar, slurred by drink but honest because of the same?
<br><br>
He didn’t know how to care, then. Is still terrible at it, put frankly. Maybe Ace did, once, but he certainly doesn’t now. Funny, how caring has found the cracks in both of their armor. And when it does, Bets has found, it doesn’t leave easily.
<br><br>
<em>“I know that feelin’,”</em> he replies.
<br><br>
<em>“I…don’t.”</em>
<br><br>
<em>“Mm…”</em> Bets doesn’t push. Knows that the other man will figure it out on his own. And he does, and he says:
<br><br>
<em>“Guess I do now.”</em>
<br><br>
<em>“I guess you do.”</em> Bets lets the silence hang, just for a moment. There is no sound of parting flesh, no hiss of the cautery. There is just the heartbeat of the station, the way it churns around them, a cage for broken things learning how to be <em>people</em> in small, painful ways. He inhales, exhales. Speaks again. 
<br><br>
<em>“Speakin’ from experience. Runnin’ always seems like the option that’ll hurt less, when you start to care. Because it makes a home in your chest, and when things go wrong…”</em> He brings his hands up to his ribcage as claws, pulling them apart as if tearing a hole in his chest. <em>“It’s got nowhere to go. But…”</em> He tilts his head back, the glass cool against his scales. <em>“I think runnin’ just gives it more space to fill. So make peace with it.”</em> He straightens, turning to look at Ace as he leans back towards the window, right shoulder pressed against it. <em>“You’re right fucked, but…you’re stuck with me.”</em>
<br><br>
Something complex flashes in Ace’s white eyes, before he replies, <em>“And you’re stuck w-with m-me, too.”</em> And before either realizes it, both have tapped a finger against their scarred throats, and Ace’s face breaks into that deceivingly innocent grin as he laughs. <em>“Jinx,”</em> he says, and Bets turns his head just slightly to stick his tongue out. 
<br><br>
The reptilian shifts as both relax, a tension neither had recognized before it disappeared broken. <em>“Thank you. For the warnin’. Even if it wasn’t strictly necessary.”</em>
<br><br>
Ace nods. <em>“Thank you for the…w-witnessing.”</em>
<br><br>
Bets inclines his head toward him. <em>“Provin’ a point requires someone to see you make it. I get that.”</em> He notices how Ace frowns momentarily, but is distracted by the alert pinging in his ears. Gas leak. Duty calls.
<br><br>
Ace shoos him away, but it is not unfriendly. <em>“Go d-deal with that,”</em> he says, another mirror, reflecting Bets nudging him towards the maintenance tunnel when their roles had been reversed. Bets laughs.
<br><br>
<em>“Yeah, yeah,”</em> he says, and without thinking, he knocks the side of his head into the glass where Ace’s would be if the window was not between them.
<br><br>
(A forehead colliding with his, a laugh. “Lizard hug,” said in a voice that sung friendship.)
<br><br>
Bets walks away. Still a little scared. But better scared together than comfortable alone.
