"You're a kind person, Bets."
<br><br>
Even coming from one of the most fucked up people he knows, it is a knife in the gut, because he knows Tye wouldn't lie to him. Knows that the worst people are also the ones who tend to know goodness when they see it, because everyone is wired to chase after the things they recognize themselves as lacking.
<br><br>
So why see it in him? This isn't kindness. The work he's doing now, dragging the broken and bloodied back to a Medbay filled with ghosts (the scent of ash hangs heavy in the air, but he's the only one who notices), is his confessional. It is retribution. Bets says he'll take his word for it, but words are so quickly rendered ash when everything inside you is ablaze (it is shame, it is guilt, it is sorrow). 
<br><br>
He apologized to Cori. Told her it wasn't just a job. While there would have been a point in lying, it felt wrong. Wrong to pretend that she understood, that she knew why he did it. They were not the same. He couldn't stand that flash in her eyes, knowing that she thought she knew him. She can't. She can't know the ugly, lit fuse he still feels burning down steadily towards something that will tear his world apart. 
<br><br>
He did lie, in the end. When he said it wouldn't happen again. But he believes her trust in that promise to be a mercy. With luck, next time, she won't remember that he broke it. 
<br><br>
This is not a kindness. He is not kind. 
<br><br>
The call comes out (dead on the ATS, bloodreds. Four). Nobody will let him go retrieve the body, nobody will let him mend their wounds. His friends are dying and every part of him screams to pour the guilt he feels into needle and gauze and ointment. Let him fix something. Anything. 
<br><br>
Twice he sees them, and he debates rushing in anyways (salvation hides chambered down the barrel of a gun).
<br><br>
But still, he wants to live. What has he done to deserve it?
<br><br>
They thank him, in the end. It hangs empty. This is not kindness. It is absolution.
