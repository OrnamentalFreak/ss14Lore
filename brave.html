Bets frowns as he examines the blood that has seeped through the joints of his salvage suit. The nanofibers sealed off the holes in the sturdy fabric layer immediately, but the marks of his impatience still stain the dark material even darker. He sighs. Best head to medbay, then. He sometimes thinks that this kind of caution ill suits him, takes away from the high of living despite the odds (as he has told people before, the gamble is no fun if you stack the deck). But he has friends who care, and he knows that a failure to take care of himself will hurt them in ways he has sworn off of. 
<br><br>
He can’t keep hurting people unnecessarily. The necessary hurts weigh heavily enough.
<br><br>
As the airlocks hiss open, he is met with the sharp smell of chemicals and the muted hum of the cryotubes a room over. He shivers, despite himself. No need for them now, but since he’s taken up a line of work that involves a lot of fights with a lot of shit with sharp teeth, he knows his visits there will likely become more frequent. And they never get any warmer.
<br><br>
Attacus looks pissed, which is unsurprising. He always is. Bets has no real dislike for the man, actually finds him quite funny, really. But he is quite aware that he has long been a thorn in Attacus’s side. Not that he’s ever done anything to alleviate that, mind. Which is part of why it’s surprising when Attacus tells him that they need to talk. He tilts his head, mentally running through a list of recent shifts. Those memories are blurry, twice broken by awakenings in cloning tubes, but he certainly can’t recall doing anything foolish enough to warrant such a response. Unless…
<br><br>
No. Dark hair on the headset. Not her.
<br><br>
He shrugs. Attacus has a trainee, but says he’ll call when he’s ready. So Bets goes back to work, hoping that he can find some escape from the worm of anxiety gnawing at him out in the quiet of space.
<br><br>
When he does call, they go to the bar. This is some relief, as Bets assumes that anything truly heinous would be discussed somewhere…less public. Pyrrha and Nyx sit a short ways away, sounding awfully serious, and Bets feels almost tempted to eavesdrop until Attacus lowers his voice and speaks. It takes some muttering, and grumbling, and beating around the bush, but the words that he finally reaches are entirely unexpected:
<br><br>
<em>“Thank you.”</em>
<br><br>
Bets listens as he explains, and though Attacus is vague, he gets the gist. Something went wrong. He died. That he already knew, one doesn’t wake up in a cloning pod because the shift went <em>well</em>. What he didn’t know is that he died for someone <em>else</em>.
<br><br>
</p>
<p class="flashback">
“The thrusters are gone.”
<br><br>
The short phrase hits Bets like a gunshot, and his stomach drops as he follows Molly’s blue-haloed, hardsuited gaze. He can see Drafts shaking. Despite everything, despite being just an engineer today, he knows that this is his responsibility. He can protect them. He has to.
<br><br>
At least one dragon is at evac. Maybe both. But it’s the only option.
<br><br>
He growls to himself. When did he start caring? He knows the answer to that, can still feel ghost-light hands on his shoulders sometimes, still wonders whenever the lights flicker: Has it happened again? Is it his fault? But he is about to do something tremendously, selflessly foolish, and that isn’t him…is it?
<br><br>
A new game, a new hand.

<p class="flashback">
They’re here.
<br><br>
The evac shuttle lies decimated. Metal groans, someone screams for a moment before the sound cuts off with a <span style="font-style: normal;">crunch</span>. They have to board. Staying isn’t an option. To stay is to die, and they have to make it…
<br><br>
...at least one of them has to make it home.
<br><br>
Drafts rushes forward, and Bets lunges. Too slow. Why find her bravery now? He curses, and grabs Molly by the shoulder as she, too, moves towards the airlock.
<br><br>
One of them has to make it home.
<br><br>
The locker is just barely large enough. He heaves, panic surging through him (this is stupid, this is stupid, Bets you are going to DIE this should be YOU—) and becoming strength. She struggles, but he manages to shut the door, wrapping his tail around it such that it acts as a barricade. He drags the locker into the shuttle, watching as the monsters slither back onboard. Watching as they tear into oh god they’re killing her oh god DON’T LOOK AT THEM YOU CAN’T YOU HAVE TO MOVE. He shoves the locker to the side, and has no time to steel himself before charging forward.
<br><br>
He begs without words for her to stay put as they rip him apart.
<br><br>
</p>
<p>
Bets sighs.
<br><br>
<em>“That both…does an’ doesn’t sound like me.”</em>
<br><br>
He frowns into the bottom of the empty glass, as if somewhere in the dregs he will find an explanation for all of this. But, really, he already knows it.
<br><br>
He laughs.
<br><br>
<em>“I’ve been hangin’ around Ev too much.”</em>
<br><br>
It doesn't occur to him until later that the realization doesn’t scare him anymore.
