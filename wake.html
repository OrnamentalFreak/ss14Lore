Bets-It-All wakes with a tongue that feels as if it is embroiled in a deeply toxic relationship with the roof of his mouth: bitter, painful, and yet still glued together for some reason. He groans, forcing his eyes open to the glare of fluorescent lights, the chiming of the desk-mounted tablet by his bedside causing the pain in his head to worsen with every beatific note. He knows where he is even before the room comes into focus, the lines of its clean white walls broken intermittently by blue-green tiles denoting a space built to support both civilian and medical purposes. The regulars call it the tank, heralding back to an age where drunkards were kept under lock and key until the sun came up; or sometimes the cradle, since you sometimes woke up in a starkly clinical room with no idea where or who the hell you were. But Bets is familiar enough with the process that neither question is a mystery to him.<br><br>
He calls it purgatory: A space between the heaven of forgetting and the hell of remembering what drove you to drink in the first place.<br><br>
In practice, this room (and all the rest like it) is where they toss you after gathering your sleeping body from the bar, or if you fail the blood alcohol test in your cryo tube. Alcohol doesn't freeze well, and even if it did, a slowed metabolism means that when you woke up you’d be just as far gone as when the tube put you under. <br><br>
Bets finalizes the messy divorce between tongue and mouth, and moves to lick his dry lips. He freezes as his tongue moves to the right side of his mouth to meet warped flesh and cold air.<br><br>
Shit. Shit, shit, shit—<br><br>
He startes to bring a hand up towards his face, but the skin and scales of his arm feel strangely resistant to his movements. With pain and trepidation, he turns his head.<br><br>
Burn scars shine black and red up the length of his arm, like the scales had melted into a fluid pool and half-solidified as he slept. He can feel it, now that he focuses, a numbness that spreads in a horror-inducing patchwork across his entire body. A childlike whimper escapes his mouth. What has happened to him?<br><br>
With a shaking hand, he silences the alarm that has chirped merrily beside him throughout the process. He needs to think. His memories, too, are a patchwork: A kind face, twisting into a cruel grin. Flame against violet glass. Pounding his fists against the door even as the heat melted the hardsuit into them, and oh god it hurt oh god it burned <em>ohgodjustlethimdieitBURNS</em>—<br><br>
His breathing comes ragged, and he forces it to calm, to still for just a few moments. Dead men don’t drink. So they had brought him back. It feels…almost cruel. What does he do with this weight? Of betrayal, of a body that bears trauma written into his flesh, with scars too big to hide. There will be questions. He doesn’t know if he’ll be able to bring himself to answer.<br><br>
He needs a drink.<br><br>
Slowly, slowly, he props himself upright, then swings his legs over the edge of the bed. He aches everywhere, and he knows now it’s not just from the hangover. His movements slowed by both pain and dread, he shuffles into the small alcove tucked into the side of the room. He fumbles for the lightswitch, and his hands seem to refuse the orders to shed light on the aftermath of what happened yesterday. But he needs to know. He needs to see.<br><br>
And there is light, and a stranger’s face in the mirror.<br><br>
There are parts of himself that he recognizes. NanoTrasen medical staff prioritize the parts of a person that make them an asset: His eyes and ears are his own. But the side of his mouth pulled upward in a permanent, teeth-exposing grin is not his. The rows of tattered frills cascading down the sides of his neck are not his. The throat that heaves under knots of scar tissue as he swallows, hard, fighting off tears, is not his.<br><br>
He grips the edges of the sink in front of him, forcing himself to recognize the image as himself. He moves, runs hands over the warped and scarred pieces of the man he sees before him, reminding himself that despite the far-away sensations of touch produced by his deadened nerves, that that sense is his own. <br><br>
He does not leave for a very, very long time. When he does, he goes to the bar.

this iteration was meant to be temporary. like all the rest. But…<br><br>
it solved the riddle. the problem that’s plagued the entire project since its inception. the subject, being an amalgamation of nt cloning data, has no past<br><br>
people rely on memory to be. well. people<br><br>
and while it still does not have real memories… it has something else

False recollections implanted by a near-death experience.

Poor taste, but not incorrect. Its neurological patterns are showing remarkable stability, despite the trauma. Its sense of self is concrete, even if its emotions are still volatile. It may yet piece together the fact that those memories are false, but an extended period of “selfhood,” such as it is, may work to counteract the impact.<br><br>

We did it.
