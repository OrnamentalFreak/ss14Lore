You step out of the shuttle, the crush of bodies flowing past you like water, like blood, like liquid life. The noise, which had you nearly crawling out of your skin during FTL, fades away as they all move away. You cautiously raise a hand to your helmet. You were told that the atmosphere was breathable, but you have never been somewhere with real sky, even if this one is shrouded in night. It is…too much.
<br><br>
A small crunch pulls your attention. Everett is laughing, their boots sinking into the snow. Pushing past your hesitancy, you release your helmet’s catch, bracing yourself for inhospitable cold and the sharp emptiness of non-atmosphere. All of your memories have prepared you to hate this, for it to be hostile.
<br><br>
But there is air, and there are snowflakes landing on your nose, and you are being pulled onto the ice. This is more than just a thin layer over the station floor, this is real and solid and you are horrifically clumsy but something sings in your chest as you move. You, too, laugh.
<br><br>
This is yours. These memories are yours. The light from Everett’s headlamp catches the snow as it falls, a million crystalline shards flashing in the dark. Each point of light burns a hole through something deep within your mind, scorching away all things borrowed to replace them with something real and potent and belonging purely to you.
<br><br>
You have, for a long while now, wanted to live. And here you are, full of wonder, with cold air in your lungs, feeling something that you think might be joy.
<br><br>
For the first time, you feel alive.
