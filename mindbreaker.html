PROJECT MINDBREAKER: ITERATION RECORD
</h3>
<p>
AUTHOR: Broken-Fractals<br>
ENCRYPTION: HighSec<br>
<br>
OVERVIEW: Project Mindbreaker iterations will all take reptilian form, as that is the physiology that I am most comfortable operating on, for obvious reasons. Mindbreaker clones are designed primarily to circumvent mindshields, but promising iterations may be kept and utilized even while their primary utility remains flawed, as the benefits of having a purpose-built agent cannot be overstated. Approval from Roots is required for any clone to be retained in this manner. She has also decided on a name for them, fitting with reptilian conventions: Bets-It-All. She knows how much is riding on this, and I cannot say I appreciate her sense of humour.

<strong>ITERATION 01 (ALPHA)</strong><br><br>
Created as a proof of concept, Alpha experienced an immediate and profound mental collapse due to information overload. It survived for a total of seven hours, was vocal for five, and bled from the eyes, ears, and nose for the final two before entering a state of brain death.<br><br>
For future iterations, either a limited dataset or more thorough mental blocks will be required.<br><br>
<strong>ITERATION 02 (CADET)</strong>
<br><br>
As a test of an experimental, limited, specialized dataset; Cadet’s memory data was pulled only from NT military and security personnel. While the failure of such an experiment was expected, the damage it was able to inflict upon both its environment and its supervisor (me) was extensive. Thank fuck for flesh anomaly regenerative properties, or this likely would have been the end of me. Once incapacitated, the body was dispatched and the brain was placed in a man-machine interface, wherein it did little but proclaim loyalty to NanoTrasen and a profound rejection of the Cybersun allegiance we attempted to instill in it.
<br><br>
If nothing else, this demonstrates the martial capability of the clones, and suggests that the effects of mindshields may not be entirely counteracted by the removal of the implant itself. That said, I am many things, but a psychologist is not one of them. While I know that Roots is reluctant to bring anyone else into the operation, I may press her again about the possibility of bringing someone in to fill that role.
<br><br>
<strong>ITERATION 03 (EXPLORER)</strong>
<br><br>
Explorer was created with a sort of proto-mindshield acting as a memory filter. Once again, it is a composite of all cloning data available to us. We had some concerns about the Mindbreaker protocol attacking this safeguard, concerns that were not unfounded. Explorer displayed relative stability for a week’s time, and was introduced into the general population as a passenger aboard a large station. Upon being asked questions about its system of origin, past employment, and general history, Explorer displayed a panic response that devolved in much the same manner as the Alpha iteration. Retrieval and analysis of the brain indicates that, like an immune system targeting a disease, once the clone was made aware of the holes in its memory the Mindbreaker protocol killed off large swathes of brain tissue.
<br><br>
Regardless of the final outcome, we are considering this a mild success.
<br><br>
<strong>ITERATION 04 (COCOON)</strong>
<br><br>
Unlike previous iterations, Cocoon was kept in a state of semiconscious stasis for several months, undergoing the same direct-to-brain education used aboard colony ships with populations in long-term cryosleep. This allowed it to gain some greater context for the world it emerged into, allowing it to function for a total of 124 days before experiencing a mental break. I have not been able to concretely identify the cause of this break, and the fact of the matter is that it was likely just a ticking time bomb. It is, however, a tremendous improvement upon previous iterations, and our cleanup squad was able to remove and secure the bodies before the incident could be reported.
<br><br>
While we do not have the luxury of time, and therefore cannot repeat the entire process, we are cautiously optimistic about using the memory data stored after Cocoon’s awakening to simulate the experience in future clones.
<br><br>
<strong>ITERATION 05 [[REDACTED]]</strong>
<br><br>
Nope. Nope. Not even worth the risk of recording. Not fucking happening. Roots: Do not fuck with my data like that ever again. Fucking hell.
<br><br>
<strong>ITERATION 06 (GAMBLER)</strong>
<br><br>
Using data from 03 and 04, iteration was developed with a “layered” memory state. Explained visually: The amalgam of cloning data forms a dense core, protected by a semipermeable “membrane” of shielding. This allows memories/learned skills to rise to the surface as needed without flooding the iteration’s brain with memory data. Beyond that is a soft sense of self, derived largely from the on-station memories of our partial successes. Unlike previous iterations, its status as an agent (but not the nature of the project) was also explained to it prior to its release into the population. This was done with the intent of reducing the dissonance between any sense of self it developed based on NT data and its activated status (my current hypothesis about 04’s sudden decline). Additionally, at Roots’s behest, Gambler was presented with a coin and prompted to flip it when making key decisions. This coin was weighted, and its trajectory could be assigned remotely by Roots herself, meaning that Gambler was less likely to consistently choose the…messier option, unlike a certain iteration. Thus, it retained a sense of control while also being, well, under control.
<br><br>
Gambler lasted a total of 278 days. Additionally, against my better judgement, Roots has allowed Chases to bring its psychologist into the fold. While I think that this is unwise, given Sparks’s NanoTrasen affiliation, this does fill the position I requested to be filled almost two years ago (a request which was, I will note, summarily denied). Sparks spoke to the clone at length before it was decommissioned, and has made some suggestions that I will admit are compelling enough to take into consideration.
<br><br>
<strong>ITERATION 07 (BETS-IT-ALL)</strong>
<br><br>
We did it. We really fucking did it.
<br><br>
ADDENDUM: Sense of self may be too strong. Bets-It-All has displayed an ability to form tight-knit bonds and, arguably more importantly, feel guilt. Clones were meant to be unable to process emotions beyond very muted versions of the six basics. It will be monitored, and, if necessary, consigned.
<br><br>
<strong>ITERATION 08 (HARLEQUIN)</strong>
<br><br>
While 07 remains active and retained, its body was retrieved after a NanoTrasen station was lost to nuclear operatives and deemed beyond saving. As such, its brain was able to be repurposed, and reseated in a new body. While reckless cloning can and will be tracked by NT authorities, and we cannot create a new brain without MedSec crawling up our asses about it, we were able to repurpose an AgriGrow biomass processor generally used for cattle in order to grow the required flesh. Harlequin was, at a base level, functional, but the body partially rejected the brain. Harlequin cannot speak, and while lacking the nerve damage present on 07, cannot feel pain. Sparks believes that this indicates that some of 07’s inability to feel pain is cognitive rather than somatic, but it provides a combat advantage, so I do not feel compelled to attempt restoration of the sense.
<br><br>
Overall stability of Harlequin seems reduced as compared to the early stages of other iterations, but also does not appear to be in decay. It is a perfectly serviceable agent, but cannot replace 07 as a Mindbreaker candidate. As such, 07 will remain in service for the time being.
<br><br>
<strong>ITERATION 09 (MESSENGER)</strong>
<br><br>
Against my better judgement, I pulled directly from 05’s cloning data. Roots was smug as hell about that one, I will have on-record. However, the intent was to either replace 07 entirely or simply send a message, and it did the latter incredibly effectively. Some of its memories were supplemented with those available to us after 07’s most recent data backups, meaning it was able to target those close to 07 with remarkable precision, even if it was only able to kill one of them. Its death was a boon, really: I will admit I would be sorry to see our stable iteration gone so soon. Perhaps 07 is right. It may, actually, be rather lucky.
