<em>
  Pathetic, sinking thing. Can't you feel the tide rising? The water is in your mouth, your throat, your lungs. Your dying breaths will choke out the song of the salt and the sea. Oh how you have thrashed and fought to stay afloat. But it has always come back to drowning for you, hasn't it?<br><br>
  Drowning in the gaps in your memory, endless pits ripe for falling into, empty boreholes left by the maggot spawn of countless selves layered upon one another. Drowning in the push and pull of social cost, no favours given, no favours owed. Drowning in the alcohol bite, the medical bitterness that slicks your tongue, holding guilt down below the water until it stops thrashing. <br><br>
  Put down the gun. Your guilt clouds your judgement, your fear that the past will cry echoes into the present. You're not a hero, and you never will be. You are tying bonds about your ankles like anchors, and they are going to bind you to the bottom of the sea until the fish have stripped the flesh from your bones, a debt repaid to the earth for wasting precious meat on one doomed to accomplish nothing save for bitterness and drunken spectacle. You can still free yourself. The skin has not yet entirely grown over the chafing wounds left by your bindings. It will hurt to tear them free, but you still can. You MUST.<br><br>
  Why keep moving? You are one small man, up against a force of nature twisted for personal gain. You are not enough. You may take solace, now, in the comrades around you, may take pride in the killing blow, but look around. What have you lost?<br><br>
  You're still not enough. <br><br>
  You still can't save them all.
